      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl born around 1412 who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role in revitalizing French morale and leading French forces to several key victories, most notably the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which helped pave the way for Charles VII's coronation as king. Captured by the Burgundians in 1430, she was handed over to the English, tried for heresy, and executed in 1431. Joan was later canonized as a saint in 1920. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a pivotal figure in the history of France and the Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she grew up during a tumultuous period marked by the ongoing conflict between England and France. This war was characterized by territorial disputes and claims to the French crown, leading to significant political and social upheaval.\n\nJoan's early life was steeped in the religious fervor of the time. She was deeply devout and often engaged in prayer, which she claimed led to her receiving divine visions. At the age of 13, she began to experience what she described as visions and voices, believed to be from saints such as Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These voices instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin (heir to the French throne), and to help expel the English from France. This conviction was not only a personal calling but also reflected the desperate situation of the French at that time, who were demoralized and suffering from a series of military defeats.\n\nIn 1429, after gaining the support of local military leaders and making her way to the court of Charles VII, Joan was given a small army to command. Her presence was a significant morale booster for the French troops, who were inspired by her faith and determination. One of her most notable achievements was her leadership during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which lasted from October 1428 to May 1429. The city was under siege by English forces, and its fall would have been a severe blow to French resistance. Joan arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429 and quickly motivated the French troops, leading them in a series of successful assaults against the besieging English forces. The lifting of the siege on May 8, 1429, marked a turning point in the war and reinvigorated French resistance.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan's influence grew, and she played a key role in the subsequent coronation of Charles VII. She insisted that he be crowned at Reims, a city traditionally associated with the coronation of French kings, to legitimize his claim to the throne. On July 17, 1429, Charles was crowned king in a ceremony that Joan attended, wearing a suit of armor and carrying her banner. This event was not only significant politically but also symbolically, as it represented the resurgence of French nationalism and hope during a time of despair.\n\nHowever, Joan's fortunes would soon change. In May 1430, while fighting against the Burgundians, who were allied with the English, she was captured during a skirmish at Compi\u00e8gne. Her capture was a significant setback for the French; she was sold to the English and brought to trial in Rouen, where she faced charges of heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (as she wore male military attire). The trial was politically motivated, orchestrated by the English to discredit her and undermine Charles VII's legitimacy. Despite her articulate defense and the lack of substantial evidence against her, she was found guilty and was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19.\n\nJoan's death did not mark the end of her influence. In 1456, a posthumous retrial was conducted, which declared her innocent and a martyr. This retrial was part of a broader effort to restore her reputation and that of Charles VII, who had benefited greatly from her actions. Joan of Arc was canonized as a saint by Pope Benedict XV in 1920, and she became a symbol of French unity and nationalism.\n\nIn addition to her military and political impact, Joan of Arc has been a subject of extensive cultural and historical interest. She has inspired countless works of art, literature, and theater, including plays by George Bernard Shaw and films that depict her life and trials. Her story resonates with themes of faith, courage, and the struggle against oppression, making her an enduring figure in both French history and global culture.\n\nJoan of Arc's legacy extends beyond her military achievements. She is considered a patron saint of France, and her feast day is celebrated on May 30. Her life and martyrdom have become emblematic of the fight for justice and the power of individual conviction. In historical and modern contexts, she is often viewed as a feminist icon, representing the strength and agency of women in a male-dominated society. \n\nHer life story continues to inspire discussions about faith, leadership, and the complexities of war. In recent years, Joan of Arc has been reinterpreted in various ways, reflecting contemporary values and issues, such as gender equality and the role of women in history. Schools, churches, and organizations around the world honor her memory, and her image is often used in movements advocating for social justice and human rights.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc was not just a military leader; she was a transformative figure who galvanized a nation during one of its darkest hours. Her visions and unwavering faith led to significant military victories, helped to secure the French crown for Charles VII, and ultimately changed the course of the Hundred Years' War. Her martyrdom and subsequent canonization have solidified her place in history as a symbol of hope, resilience, and the enduring power of faith. Jeanne d'Arc, known as Joan of Arc, was a remarkable figure in the history of France and the Hundred Years' War, which spanned from 1337 to 1453. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, she emerged from humble beginnings during a period marked by intense conflict between England and France. This war was fueled by territorial disputes and competing claims to the French throne, leading to widespread suffering and disillusionment among the French populace.\n\nJoan's early life was deeply influenced by the religious fervor of her time. From a young age, she exhibited a strong devotion to her faith, which she claimed was the source of her divine visions. At just 13 years old, she began experiencing what she described as messages from saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These visions urged her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin, and to liberate France from English domination, reflecting the desperate need for hope and leadership among the French people.\n\nIn 1429, after gaining the trust of local military leaders, Joan made her way to the court of Charles VII, where she convinced him to allow her to lead an army. Her presence was transformative; she inspired the French troops, who rallied around her faith and determination. One of her most significant accomplishments was her leadership during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which lasted from October 1428 to May 1429. Joan arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, where she quickly motivated the besieged defenders and led a series of assaults that culminated in the lifting of the siege on May 8, 1429. This victory not only revitalized French morale but also marked a pivotal turning point in the war.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan insisted that Charles VII be crowned king at Reims, a traditional site for French coronations, to legitimize his claim to the throne. On July 17, 1429, Charles was crowned, with Joan by his side, symbolizing a resurgence of French nationalism and hope in the face of adversity.\n\nHowever, Joan's fortunes took a dramatic turn when she was captured by the Burgundians in May 1430 during a military engagement at Compi\u00e8",

Jeanne d'Arc, often referred to as Joan of Arc in English, remains one of the most iconic figures in French history, symbolizing courage and faith. The events leading to her trial and execution are deeply rooted in the political and military context of 15th-century France, particularly during the tumultuous period of the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) between England and France.\n\n1. **Military Successes (1429)**: Jeanne's rise to prominence began with her extraordinary military achievements. In early 1429, she convinced Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, to allow her to lead an army to relieve the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which was a pivotal moment in the war. Her presence inspired the French troops, leading to a decisive victory on May 8, 1429. Following this triumph, Jeanne accompanied Charles to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This event was not just a military victory; it had profound psychological implications, reinvigorating French nationalism and hope amidst years of English domination.\n\n2. **Capture (1430)**: Despite her earlier successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically in May 1430 when she was captured during a military campaign at Compi\u00e8gne. The siege was a failed attempt to recover the town from Burgundian control, and her capture was a significant blow to the French cause. The Burgundians, allied with the English, sold her to the English forces, who saw an opportunity to use her as a propaganda tool against the French. Her capture was not only a military defeat but also a turning point that shifted the momentum of the war back toward the English.\n\n3. **Trial Initiation (1431)**: The English, eager to discredit Jeanne and undermine the French morale, sought to put her on trial. Bishop Pierre Cauchon, a pro-English cleric, was appointed to oversee the proceedings. The trial began in January 1431 and was marked by a series of irregularities that highlighted its political motivations. Jeanne was charged with heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (for wearing male military attire), which were serious accusations in the context of the Catholic Church's authority. The trial was not only about her alleged crimes but also aimed at delegitimizing her role in the French victory and the legitimacy of Charles VII's reign.\n\n4. **Trial Proceedings**: The trial proceedings were heavily biased. Jeanne was subjected to intense questioning and psychological manipulation, with the court seeking to extract confessions that would support their claims. Despite the pressure, Jeanne displayed remarkable composure and wit, often turning the questions back on her interrogators. She maintained that she was guided by divine visions and insisted on her innocence. However, the court was more interested in a predetermined outcome than in a fair trial. On May 24, 1431, after several weeks of hearings, Jeanne was declared guilty of heresy and sentenced to death.\n\n5. **Execution (May 30, 1431)**: On the morning of May 30, 1431, Jeanne was led to the stake in Rouen. Her execution was public, intended to serve as a warning to others who might challenge English authority or the Church's orthodoxy. As she faced her death, she reportedly called out for Jesus and expressed her unwavering faith. The sight of a young woman, only 19 years old, meeting her fate with such courage struck a chord with many, turning her into a martyr for the French cause. Her execution did not have the intended effect of quelling French resistance; instead, it galvanized support for Charles VII and the French crown.\n\nFollowing her death, Jeanne's legacy grew. In 1456, a posthumous retrial was conducted, which declared her innocent of all charges and labeled her execution as unjust. This retrial was a significant step in restoring her reputation and recognizing her contributions to France. Over the centuries, Jeanne d'Arc became a symbol of national pride and resistance against oppression. Her image was further romanticized in literature, art, and popular culture, portraying her as a heroine and a saint.\n\nIn 1920, Jeanne was canonized by the Catholic Church, affirming her status as a saint and solidifying her legacy within the Church. Today, she is celebrated as a national heroine in France, and her story continues to inspire countless individuals around the world. Jeanne d'Arc's life and death serve as a powerful reminder of the complexities of faith, politics, and the struggle for justice, making her one of history's most enduring figures. Jeanne d'Arc, often referred to as Joan of Arc in English, remains a pivotal figure in French history and a symbol of resilience and faith. The key events leading to her trial and eventual execution are deeply intertwined with the socio-political landscape of 15th-century France, particularly during the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), which saw a protracted struggle between England and France for control over French territories.\n\n1. **Military Successes (1429)**: Jeanne's rise to prominence began with her extraordinary military achievements.

This event was not just a military victory; it had profound psychological implications, reinvigorating French nationalism and hope amidst years of English domination. Jeanne's belief that she was divinely inspired to support Charles added a layer of religious significance to her military endeavors, further solidifying her role as a national figure.\n\n2. **Capture (1430)**: Despite her earlier successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically in May 1430 when she was captured during a military campaign at Compi\u00e8gne.

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc first claimed to receive visions in 1425. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, first claimed to receive her divine visions in 1425, when she was around 13 years old. These visions reportedly came from saints and angels, most notably Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. They instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to help him reclaim his throne from the English, who were occupying significant portions of France during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe context of her visions is critical to understanding her motivations and actions. The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was a protracted conflict between England and France, marked by a struggle for control over the French throne. By the early 15th century, England had gained substantial territory in France, and Charles VII's claim to the throne was weak, as he was not the only contender. The French people were demoralized and divided, and the situation seemed dire.\n\nJeanne's visions were not merely personal revelations; they were perceived as a calling to fulfill a national destiny. After years of living in relative obscurity in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she began to take her visions seriously. In 1428, after several years of internal struggle and contemplation, she sought to meet Charles VII. She believed that her divine mission was to lead the French forces against the English and to ensure the coronation of Charles as the rightful king of France.\n\nIn early 1429, Jeanne made her way to Vaucouleurs, where she convinced the local garrison commander, Robert de Baudricourt, to support her mission. He was initially skeptical but eventually relented and provided her with a small escort to take her to Charles VII, who was at the time in Chinon. Upon meeting Charles in March 1429, Jeanne reportedly recognized him despite him being in disguise, which further convinced him of her divine purpose. She presented him with a message that she claimed to have received from God: that he should take back the city of Orl\u00e9ans, which was under siege by the English.\n\nJeanne's arrival in the French court marked a significant turning point in the war. She was given armor and a horse, and she quickly became a symbol of hope for the beleaguered French troops. Her presence at the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429 was pivotal. She inspired the French soldiers with her fervor and determination, and under her leadership, they achieved a remarkable victory against the English forces. This victory not only boosted French morale but also solidified Jeanne's status as a national heroine.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne continued to support Charles VII, who was ultimately crowned King of France on July 17, 1429, at Reims Cathedral. Jeanne's role in this event was monumental; she stood beside the king during the coronation, fulfilling the mission she had been given in her visions. However, her fortunes changed dramatically in the years that followed.\n\nIn May 1430, Jeanne was captured during a military campaign at Compi\u00e8gne, where she was leading a French relief effort. The Burgundians, who were allied with the English, seized her and sold her to the English. She was imprisoned and subjected to a politically motivated trial, where she was accused of heresy and witchcraft. Despite her courage and eloquence, she was convicted and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy has endured through the centuries. She was posthumously exonerated in 1456, and her trial was declared invalid. In 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, recognized not only for her military leadership but also for her deep faith and commitment to her beliefs. Today, she is celebrated as a national heroine of France and a symbol of courage, conviction, and the fight for justice.\n\nHer life has inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, reflecting her enduring influence on culture and history. Jeanne d'Arc remains a powerful figure in discussions about nationalism, gender, and religious conviction, illustrating how one person's faith and determination can alter the course of history. Her story serves as a reminder of the complexities of war, the role of women in history, and the intersection of faith and politics. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, stands as one of history's most iconic figures, not only for her military prowess but also for the profound impact of her visions and the fervent belief that guided her actions. Her claims of divine inspiration began in 1425 when she was just 13 years old, and these visions shaped not only her destiny but also the course of French history during a tumultuous period marked by the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was a complex conflict characterized by a series of battles and political maneuvers over the rightful claim to the French throne. By the early 15th century, England had made significant inroads into French territory, and the legitimacy of Charles VII's claim to the throne was precarious. The French populace was demoralized, facing not only military defeats but also internal divisions. In this context, Jeanne's visions, which she described as messages from saints\u2014most notably Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret\u2014provided a sense of hope and purpose.\n\nJeanne's visions instructed her to support Charles VII and to drive the English from French soil. They represented a divine mandate that transcended her personal aspirations, positioning her as a figure of national importance. After years of contemplation and struggle with her calling, she sought to meet Charles VII in 1428. Her determination led her to Vaucouleurs, where, against initial skepticism, she convinced the local commander to assist her in reaching the Dauphin.\n\nWhen Jeanne met Charles VII in March 1429, she not only recognized him despite his disguise\u2014an event that further convinced him of her divine mission\u2014but she also delivered a clear message from God: the need to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. This marked a pivotal moment in both her life and the broader conflict. By April 1429, Jeanne was actively involved in the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, where her presence revitalized the French troops. Her leadership and unwavering faith played a crucial role in the French victory, which was a turning point in the war. This triumph not only bolstered French morale but also solidified her status as a national symbol of resistance against English occupation.\n\nThe coronation of Charles VII on July 17, 1429, at Reims Cathedral, was a culmination of Jeanne's mission. She stood proudly beside the king, fulfilling the divine purpose she had been given. However, the course of history took a darker turn soon after. In May 1430, while leading a military campaign, Jeanne was captured by Burgundian forces allied with the English. Her imprisonment and subsequent trial were politically motivated, reflecting the turbulent power dynamics of the time.\n\nJeanne was subjected to a trial that accused her of heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing\u2014charges that were deeply intertwined with the contemporary societal norms and the political machinations of her enemies. Despite her articulate defense and the fervor of her faith, she was convicted and executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the tender age of 19. Her martyrdom only further solidified her legacy, transforming her from a military leader into a symbol of faith and resilience.\n\nIn 1456, a posthumous retrial exonerated Jeanne, declaring her trial invalid and recognizing her as a martyr.

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War between France and England, which lasted from 1337 to 1453. Her leadership and inspiration were crucial, particularly during the critical phase of the war in the early 15th century. \n\nOne of her most notable achievements was the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in October 1428. The city was strategically important as it was one of the last major French strongholds on the Loire River and served as a gateway to the south of France. The English forces, having occupied much of northern France, aimed to capture Orl\u00e9ans to further their control over the region. Jeanne arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, after having gained the support of Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, who was struggling to assert his claim to the throne amidst the English occupation.\n\nUpon her arrival, Jeanne quickly became a symbol of hope and unity for the beleaguered French troops and the citizens of Orl\u00e9ans. She urged the French forces to take action and inspired them with her unwavering faith and determination. Her presence and leadership helped to rally the French troops, who had been demoralized by the prolonged siege. \n\nOn May 7, 1429, after a series of skirmishes and tactical maneuvers, the French forces, under Jeanne's command, launched a successful assault on the English fortifications surrounding Orl\u00e9ans. This decisive victory not only lifted the siege but also marked a turning point in the war. The triumph at Orl\u00e9ans reinvigorated the French cause and significantly boosted the morale of the French troops and population.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc continued to lead the French army on a campaign to retake territories held by the English. One of her key objectives was to facilitate the coronation of Charles VII. Jeanne believed that Charles was divinely ordained to be king, and she sought to ensure he received the recognition and legitimacy that came with a royal coronation. \n\nJeanne and the French army moved towards Reims, the traditional site of French coronations. Along the way, they captured several towns, including Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency, further weakening English control in the region. Each victory contributed to the momentum of the French campaign and demonstrated Jeanne's military acumen and strategic insight.\n\nOn July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned king at Reims, with Jeanne d'Arc by his side. This event was monumental, as it not only solidified Charles's claim to the throne but also symbolized the resurgence of French nationalism and unity against the English invaders. The coronation was seen as a fulfillment of Jeanne's mission and a divine endorsement of Charles's reign.\n\nDespite her successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed following the coronation. In May 1430, she participated in the defense of Compi\u00e8gne, where she was captured by Burgundian forces, allies of the English. Her capture marked a significant turning point in the conflict. The Burgundians sold her to the English, who put her on trial for charges including heresy and witchcraft. \n\nJeanne was ultimately convicted and executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431.

The French continued to fight against the English, and ultimately, France emerged victorious in 1453, reclaiming its territories and ending the conflict.\n\nIn 1920, Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, further solidifying her status as a national heroine and a figure of religious significance. Her life and legacy continue to inspire countless individuals, and she is often regarded as a symbol of courage, faith, and the fight for justice. The story of Jeanne d'Arc is not only a tale of military achievement but also one of profound spiritual conviction and the power of belief in shaping history. \n\nHer influence can be seen in various cultural representations, including literature, art, and film, where she is often depicted as a brave young woman who defied the odds and changed the course of history. Jeanne d'Arc remains an enduring icon of French identity and a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have on the world stage. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of history's most compelling figures, not only for her military achievements but also for her profound impact on French national identity and the socio-political landscape of her time. Her leadership during the Hundred Years' War against English forces was marked by a series of pivotal victories, particularly at Orl\u00e9ans and during the subsequent campaigns that facilitated the coronation of Charles VII.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in October 1428, was a crucial moment in the conflict. The English, having gained significant ground, sought to capture this strategic city to solidify their dominance in France. When Jeanne arrived in April 1429, she was not just a military leader; she embodied the hope of a nation yearning for liberation. Her famous declaration that she was sent by God to save France galvanized the troops and the citizens alike, transforming the atmosphere of despair into one of renewed vigor and determination.\n\nJeanne's military strategy was notable for its boldness and innovation. Rather than relying solely on traditional siege warfare tactics, she encouraged swift assaults and inspired her troops to engage the English in direct confrontations. The victory at Orl\u00e9ans on May 7, 1429, was achieved through a combination of her strategic planning and the bravery of her soldiers. This victory not only lifted the siege but also served as a rallying point for the French, showcasing Jeanne's ability to inspire and lead in dire circumstances.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne's focus shifted towards facilitating Charles VII's coronation. She believed that his ascension to the throne would galvanize the French people and legitimize their struggle against English occupation. The French army, under her guidance, captured key towns along the way to Reims, including Jargeau and Beaugency. Each victory not only weakened English control but also built a sense of momentum and unity among the French forces.\n\nThe coronation of Charles VII on July 17, 1429, at Reims Cathedral was a watershed moment in French history. Jeanne stood beside the new king, and the ceremony was imbued with symbolic significance. It represented not just the formal acknowledgment of Charles's kingship but also the spiritual and national revival of France. This event marked a turning point in the Hundred Years' War, as it fostered a renewed sense of national identity and purpose among the French populace.\n\nHowever, Jeanne's fortunes took a drastic turn after the coronation. In May 1430, during the defense of Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, who were allied with the English. Her imprisonment was a significant blow to the French cause, as her presence had been a unifying force for the troops. The English, seeking to undermine her legacy, put her on trial for charges that included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, as she wore male military attire. The trial was politically motivated and conducted under dubious circumstances, leading to her conviction and execution by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431.\n\nDespite her tragic end, Jeanne d'Arc's legacy endured. The years following her death saw a resurgence of French nationalism, and her story became emblematic of the struggle for freedom and justice. In 1453, France ultimately emerged victorious in the Hundred Years' War, reclaiming its territories and solidifying its national identity. Jeanne's influence was instrumental in this outcome, as her actions had sparked a sense of unity and purpose among the French.\n\nIn recognition of her profound impact on history and culture, Jeanne was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920.

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is considered a national heroine in France because she played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War by leading French forces to several important victories against the English. Her unwavering faith and belief in her divine mission inspired her troops and rallied the French people. Captured and executed for her beliefs, she became a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism, ultimately being canonized as a saint, which further solidified her status as a national icon. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is considered a national heroine in France because she played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War by leading French forces to several important victories against the English. Her unwavering faith and belief in her divine mission inspired her troops and rallied the French people. Captured and executed for her beliefs, she became a symbol of courage, sacrifice, and patriotism, ultimately being canonized as a saint, which further solidified her status as a national icon.\n\nBorn around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, Jeanne d'Arc was the daughter of farmers. Her early life was marked by the hardships of the ongoing conflict between France and England, which had been raging since 1337. The war had devastated much of the French countryside, and by the time she was a teenager, the French were facing severe challenges, including political fragmentation and military defeats. The English had captured significant territories, including Paris, and the French crown was in disarray.\n\nJeanne's journey began when she claimed to have received visions and messages from saints, including Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These visions instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and help him reclaim his throne from the English. At the age of 16, driven by a profound sense of divine purpose, she convinced Charles to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which was a crucial stronghold for the French.\n\nIn April 1429, Jeanne arrived at Orl\u00e9ans, where she quickly became a source of inspiration for the beleaguered French troops. Her presence alone boosted morale, and her strategic insights contributed to a series of successful assaults. The siege was lifted on May 8, 1429, in a remarkable victory for the French forces. This triumph not only changed the course of the war but also galvanized French national identity and unity, as Jeanne became a figure of hope and resilience.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne played a crucial role in the coronation of Charles VII at Reims Cathedral on July 17, 1429. This event was symbolically significant, as it reinforced the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and marked a turning point in the Hundred Years' War. Jeanne's involvement in the coronation solidified her status as a national heroine, as she was seen as the instrument of divine intervention in the restoration of the French monarchy.\n\nHowever, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically in the following years. In May 1430, she was captured by Burgundian forces\u2014French allies of the English\u2014while attempting to defend Compi\u00e8gne. She was sold to the English and taken to Rouen, where she faced a politically motivated trial led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, an English supporter. The trial was rife with irregularities and aimed at discrediting her as a heretic and witch. Jeanne was ultimately convicted and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the young age of 19.\n\nHer execution only deepened her legacy. The manner of her death, coupled with her steadfastness in the face of persecution, transformed her into a martyr. In 1456, a posthumous retrial cleared her of all charges, affirming her innocence and the political motivations behind her original trial. This retrial was a significant step in her eventual canonization, which took place in 1920, further solidifying her status as a saint in the Catholic Church.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy extends beyond her military accomplishments and martyrdom. She became a symbol of French nationalism, especially during times of crisis. Her story resonated with various movements, from the French Revolution to the two World Wars, where she was invoked as a figure of resilience and courage. In the 19th and 20th centuries, her image was romanticized in literature, art, and popular culture, reinforcing her place in the hearts of the French people.\n\nMoreover, Jeanne's life and legacy raise profound questions about faith, gender, and authority. As a woman who broke societal norms in a patriarchal society, she challenged the expectations of her time. Her leadership in a male-dominated military context and her claim to divine guidance presented a radical departure from traditional gender roles. This aspect of her life has made her an enduring figure in feminist discourse, as she embodies the struggle for female agency and empowerment.\n\nIn contemporary France, Jeanne d'Arc is celebrated annually on May 30, the anniversary of her death, with ceremonies and events that honor her memory. Statues and monuments dedicated to her can be found throughout the country, and she is often depicted in art and literature as a symbol of bravery and faith. Her legacy is also recognized in various educational curricula, where she is taught not only as a historical figure but also as an emblem of the complexities of war, faith, and national identity.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc is considered a national heroine in France for her extraordinary contributions during a tumultuous period in French history. Her leadership, faith, and ultimate sacrifice transformed her into a symbol of courage, resilience, and patriotism. As a saint, a martyr, and an icon of national pride, her story continues to inspire and resonate, making her an enduring figure not only in French history but also in the broader context of human struggle and the quest for justice and truth.

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc led French troops to significant victories against the English forces at Orl\u00e9ans and in the subsequent campaigns in the Loire Valley. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War between France and England, which lasted from 1337 to 1453. Her leadership and inspiration were crucial, particularly during the critical phase of the war in the early 15th century. \n\nOne of her most notable achievements was the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in October 1428. The city was strategically important as it was one of the last major French strongholds on the Loire River and served as a gateway to the south of France. The English forces, having occupied much of northern France, aimed to capture Orl\u00e9ans to further their control over the region. Jeanne arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, after having gained the support of Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, who was struggling to assert his claim to the throne amidst the English occupation.\n\nUpon her arrival, Jeanne quickly became a symbol of hope and unity for the beleaguered French troops and the citizens of Orl\u00e9ans. She urged the French forces to take action and inspired them with her unwavering faith and determination. Her presence and leadership helped to rally the French troops, who had been demoralized by the prolonged siege. \n\nOn May 7, 1429, after a series of skirmishes and tactical maneuvers, the French forces, under Jeanne's command, launched a successful assault on the English fortifications surrounding Orl\u00e9ans. This decisive victory not only lifted the siege but also marked a turning point in the war. The triumph at Orl\u00e9ans reinvigorated the French cause and significantly boosted the morale of the French troops and population.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc continued to lead the French army on a campaign to retake territories held by the English. One of her key objectives was to facilitate the coronation of Charles VII. Jeanne believed that Charles was divinely ordained to be king, and she sought to ensure he received the recognition and legitimacy that came with a royal coronation. \n\nJeanne and the French army moved towards Reims, the traditional site of French coronations. Along the way, they captured several towns, including Jargeau, Meung-sur-Loire, and Beaugency, further weakening English control in the region. Each victory contributed to the momentum of the French campaign and demonstrated Jeanne's military acumen and strategic insight.\n\nOn July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned king at Reims, with Jeanne d'Arc by his side. This event was monumental, as it not only solidified Charles's claim to the throne but also symbolized the resurgence of French nationalism and unity against the English invaders. The coronation was seen as a fulfillment of Jeanne's mission and a divine endorsement of Charles's reign.\n\nDespite her successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed following the coronation. In May 1430, she participated in the defense of Compi\u00e8gne, where she was captured by Burgundian forces, allies of the English. Her capture marked a significant turning point in the conflict. The Burgundians sold her to the English, who put her on trial for charges including heresy and witchcraft. \n\nJeanne was ultimately convicted and executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431. However, her legacy endured long after her death. She became a symbol of French unity and resistance, and her actions had a profound impact on the course of the Hundred Years' War. The French continued to fight against the English, and ultimately, France emerged victorious in 1453, reclaiming its territories and ending the conflict.\n\nIn 1920, Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, further solidifying her status as a national heroine and a figure of religious significance. Her life and legacy continue to inspire countless individuals, and she is often regarded as a symbol of courage, faith, and the fight for justice. The story of Jeanne d'Arc is not only a tale of military achievement but also one of profound spiritual conviction and the power of belief in shaping history. \n\nHer influence can be seen in various cultural representations, including literature, art, and film, where she is often depicted as a brave young woman who defied the odds and changed the course of history. Jeanne d'Arc remains an enduring icon of French identity and a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have on the world stage. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of history's most compelling figures, not only for her military achievements but also for her profound impact on French national identity and the socio-political landscape of her time. Her leadership during the Hundred Years' War against English forces was marked by a series of pivotal victories, particularly at Orl\u00e9ans and during the subsequent campaigns that facilitated the coronation of Charles VII.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in October 1428, was a crucial moment in the conflict. The English, having gained significant ground, sought to capture this strategic city to solidify their dominance in France. When Jeanne arrived in April 1429, she was not just a military leader; she embodied the hope of a nation yearning for liberation. Her famous declaration that she was sent by God to save France galvanized the troops and the citizens alike, transforming the atmosphere of despair into one of renewed vigor and determination.\n\nJeanne's military strategy was notable for its boldness and innovation. Rather than relying solely on traditional siege warfare tactics, she encouraged swift assaults and inspired her troops to engage the English in direct confrontations. The victory at Orl\u00e9ans on May 7, 1429, was achieved through a combination of her strategic planning and the bravery of her soldiers. This victory not only lifted the siege but also served as a rallying point for the French, showcasing Jeanne's ability to inspire and lead in dire circumstances.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne's focus shifted towards facilitating Charles VII's coronation. She believed that his ascension to the throne would galvanize the French people and legitimize their struggle against English occupation. The French army, under her guidance, captured key towns along the way to Reims, including Jargeau and Beaugency. Each victory not only weakened English control but also built a sense of momentum and unity among the French forces.\n\nThe coronation of Charles VII on July 17, 1429, at Reims Cathedral was a watershed moment in French history. Jeanne stood beside the new king, and the ceremony was imbued with symbolic significance. It represented not just the formal acknowledgment of Charles's kingship but also the spiritual and national revival of France. This event marked a turning point in the Hundred Years' War, as it fostered a renewed sense of national identity and purpose among the French populace.\n\nHowever, Jeanne's fortunes took a drastic turn after the coronation. In May 1430, during the defense of Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, who were allied with the English. Her imprisonment was a significant blow to the French cause, as her presence had been a unifying force for the troops. The English, seeking to undermine her legacy, put her on trial for charges that included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, as she wore male military attire. The trial was politically motivated and conducted under dubious circumstances, leading to her conviction and execution by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431.\n\nDespite her tragic end, Jeanne d'Arc's legacy endured. The years following her death saw a resurgence of French nationalism, and her story became emblematic of the struggle for freedom and justice. In 1453, France ultimately emerged victorious in the Hundred Years' War, reclaiming its territories and solidifying its national identity. Jeanne's influence was instrumental in this outcome, as her actions had sparked a sense of unity and purpose among the French.\n\nIn recognition of her profound impact on history and culture, Jeanne was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. Her life story continues to resonate across various mediums\u2014literature, art, and film\u2014where she is often portrayed as a symbol of courage, faith",
