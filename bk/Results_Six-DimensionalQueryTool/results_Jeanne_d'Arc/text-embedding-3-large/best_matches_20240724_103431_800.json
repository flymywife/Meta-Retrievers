      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl who claimed to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role by leading French troops to several important victories, most notably the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which boosted French morale and helped pave the way for Charles VII's coronation as king. Her contributions were significant in turning the tide of the war in favor of the French. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a pivotal figure in the history of France and the Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she grew up during a tumultuous period marked by the conflict between France and England for control of the French throne. The war had led to significant territorial losses for France and a crisis of legitimacy for its monarchy.\n\nAt the age of 13, Joan began to experience what she described as visions and voices, which she believed were divine in origin. These visions, which she attributed to saints such as Michael, Catherine, and Margaret, instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to expel the English from French territories. At the time, Charles was struggling to assert his claim to the throne, as his legitimacy was questioned due to the English occupation of large parts of France and the ongoing conflict.\n\nIn 1429, after gaining the trust of Charles VII, Joan was given command of an army to lift the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, a crucial stronghold that the English had besieged since October 1428. Joan's presence inspired the French troops, and her strategic insight played a key role in the successful siege. The victory at Orl\u00e9ans on May 8, 1429, marked a turning point in the war. It not only lifted the siege but also revitalized French morale, demonstrating that the English could be defeated.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This coronation was significant for several reasons: it solidified Charles's claim to the throne and symbolized the restoration of French national pride. Joan's role in this event was monumental; she was present at the coronation, and her actions were seen as fulfilling her divine mission.\n\nHowever, Joan's fortunes changed dramatically after the coronation. The French forces, emboldened by their earlier successes, attempted to capture Paris but faced stiff resistance. Joan was wounded in a skirmish, and the French army was ultimately unable to take the city. In 1430, during a military campaign in Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, who were allied with the English. Joan was sold to the English, and her fate took a tragic turn.\n\nIn 1431, she was put on trial by an ecclesiastical court in Rouen, where she faced charges of heresy and witchcraft. The trial was politically motivated, as the English sought to discredit her and diminish the legitimacy of Charles VII's reign. Despite her defense and her unwavering faith, she was found guilty and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19. Her trial and execution were deeply controversial and have been viewed as a miscarriage of justice.\n\nJoan of Arc was posthumously exonerated in 1456 after a retrial that found her innocent of all charges. In 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. Today, she is celebrated as a national heroine in France, symbolizing courage, faith, and the struggle for justice. Her legacy extends beyond her military achievements; she has become an enduring symbol of female empowerment and",

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, first claimed to receive divine guidance in 1425 when she was about 13 years old. This pivotal moment marked the beginning of her extraordinary journey as a peasant girl who would rise to become a national heroine of France. Jeanne reported experiencing visions and hearing voices that she attributed to saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These divine messages instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to help him reclaim his throne from the English, who were occupying large parts of France during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe Hundred Years\u2019 War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, was a series of conflicts waged between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, primarily over territorial disputes and claims to the French throne. By the early 15th century, the war had reached a critical juncture, with the English forces achieving significant victories, including the capture of important cities like Orleans. The political situation in France was dire, and Charles VII's claim to the throne was contested, which further complicated his ability to rally support against the English.\n\nJeanne's visions were not merely personal experiences; they were imbued with a sense of divine purpose. In 1429, after years of internal conflict and skepticism about her claims, Jeanne managed to gain an audience with Charles VII at the court in Chinon. Dressed in male military attire, she presented herself as a warrior of God, asserting that she had been sent to lead Charles to victory and to ensure his coronation in Reims, the traditional site for the crowning of French monarchs.\n\nHer presence and fervent conviction inspired many, and she quickly garnered a following. Jeanne convinced Charles to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege of Orleans, a crucial stronghold for the French. In April 1429, her forces achieved a remarkable victory at the Battle of Orleans, which turned the tide of the war in favor of the French.

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. Her most significant military victories occurred in 1429, a critical year that marked a turning point in the war and in the fortunes of the French crown.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in October 1428, was one of the most important military confrontations of the war. By the time Jeanne arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, the city was under siege by English forces led by the Earl of Salisbury and Sir John Fastolf. The siege had demoralized the French troops and citizens, and the fall of Orl\u00e9ans would have given the English a strategic advantage in their campaign to control the Loire Valley. Jeanne, claiming divine guidance, inspired the besieged citizens and troops. She urged them to lift the siege and led several military operations that culminated in a decisive victory for the French on May 8, 1429. This victory not only boosted French morale but also solidified Jeanne's reputation as a military leader and a symbol of national unity.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc played a crucial role in the subsequent Battle of Patay, which took place on June 18, 1429.

The French army, which included seasoned soldiers and volunteers inspired by Jeanne, managed to achieve a stunning victory, inflicting heavy casualties on the English and capturing many of their leaders. The defeat at Patay marked a significant setback for the English, who had previously enjoyed a series of victories in the war.\n\nJeanne's military successes were not just about battlefield tactics; they were also deeply intertwined with her spiritual beliefs. She claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to drive the English out of France. Her presence in the battlefield galvanized troops, many of whom were inspired by her faith and determination. The impact of her victories extended beyond the immediate military outcomes; they revitalized the French cause and helped pave the way for Charles VII's coronation as king at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event was symbolic of the resurgence of French national identity and unity against the English invaders.\n\nDespite her successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically after the coronation of Charles VII. In May 1430, she participated in a military campaign to relieve Compi\u00e8gne, where she was captured by Burgundian forces, allies of the English. Her capture marked the beginning of a tragic turn in her story. Jeanne was sold to the English and put on trial for charges including heresy and witchcraft. Despite her valiant efforts to defend herself, she was found guilty and executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy, however, lived on long after her death. She was posthumously exonerated in 1456, and her contributions to the French military efforts have been commemorated in numerous ways, including her canonization as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. Today, she is celebrated not only as a national heroine of France but also as a symbol of courage, faith, and the struggle for justice. Her story continues to inspire countless individuals around the world, transcending the historical context of the Hundred Years' War. \n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc's most significant military victories at Orl\u00e9ans and Patay were crucial in turning the tide of the Hundred Years' War in favor of France",

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc was put on trial and executed by burning at the stake primarily due to charges of heresy and witchcraft. Her claims of divine guidance, her role in the French military during the Hundred Years' War, and her support for Charles VII threatened the English and Burgundian interests. The trial was politically motivated, aiming to discredit her and the French crown she supported. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a peasant girl born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, France. She claimed to have received visions and messages from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and help drive the English out of France during the tumultuous period of the Hundred Years' War. Her charismatic leadership and military successes, including the lifting of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, significantly boosted French morale and contributed to Charles VII's eventual coronation at Reims.\n\nHowever, her remarkable rise also made her a target. The political landscape of 15th-century France was complex, with various factions vying for power. The English, who occupied large parts of France, were keen to undermine her influence. Jeanne's assertion of divine backing was seen as a challenge to the established order, and her actions were perceived as a direct threat to the English and Burgundian interests. Her support for Charles VII, who was seen as a legitimate heir to the French throne, further exacerbated tensions, leading to her being framed as a political adversary.\n\nIn 1430, Jeanne was captured by Burgundian forces during a military campaign and subsequently sold to the English. They recognized the potential propaganda value of her trial, as her execution could discredit Charles VII and diminish his legitimacy. The trial began in 1431 and was conducted by a pro-English ecclesiastical court in Rouen. The charges against her included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, the latter being based on her wearing male military attire, which was viewed as a violation of gender norms and biblical injunctions.\n\nThe trial was heavily biased, lacking the fairness and impartiality expected in a judicial proceeding. Jeanne was subjected to intense psychological pressure and manipulation. The court sought to extract a confession that would support their claims of heresy. Despite the overwhelming pressure, Jeanne maintained her innocence and steadfastly defended her actions as divinely inspired. Her responses often highlighted her faith and her unwavering commitment to her mission, which made her a symbol of resistance and national pride for the French.\n\nUltimately, Jeanne was found guilty and sentenced to death. On May 30, 1431, she was burned at the stake in Rouen at the age of 19. Her execution was intended to serve as a warning to others who might challenge the English and their allies. However, rather than silencing her, Jeanne's martyrdom elevated her status. Over the following decades, her story became emblematic of French nationalism and resistance against foreign oppression.\n\nIn 1456, a posthumous retrial was conducted, which exonerated Jeanne of all charges and declared her a martyr. This retrial, initiated by Charles VII, reflected the changing political landscape in France and the growing reverence for Jeanne as a national heroine. In 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, further solidifying her legacy as a figure of faith and courage.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's life and trial illustrate the intersection of religion, politics, and gender in medieval Europe. Her story continues to resonate today, symbolizing the struggle for justice and the fight against oppression. The themes of faith, patriotism, and the challenge to societal norms in her narrative have inspired countless works of art, literature, and scholarship, ensuring that her legacy endures long after her tragic death. Jeanne d'Arc remains a powerful symbol of courage and conviction, embodying the spirit of a nation in its quest for identity and independence.",
