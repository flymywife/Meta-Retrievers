      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role by leading French forces to several important victories, most notably the lifting of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which boosted French morale and helped pave the way for Charles VII's coronation. She was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, handed over to the English, and executed in 1431, later becoming a symbol of French nationalism and martyrdom. Jeanne d'Arc, commonly known as Joan of Arc, was born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France. From a young age, she claimed to have experienced divine visions and heard voices, which she believed were sent by saints like Michael, Catherine, and Margaret. These revelations urged her to take action to save France from English domination during the protracted conflict known as the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453), a struggle primarily between the Kingdoms of England and France over territorial and dynastic claims.\n\nIn 1429, during a critical phase of the war, France was in a dire situation. The English had gained significant territory, and the French crown was struggling to assert its authority. Joan's conviction and charisma led her to convince Charles VII, the Dauphin (heir to the French throne), to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which had been under English control since October 1428. Her presence inspired the French troops, and on May 8, 1429, they achieved a decisive victory, marking a turning point in the war. This triumph not only revitalized French morale but also solidified Joan's reputation as a national heroine.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan played a pivotal role in the subsequent coronation of Charles VII at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event was significant as it symbolized the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and was a moment of national unity for France. Joan's involvement in the coronation further elevated her status and solidified her as a key figure in the French resistance against English rule.\n\nHowever, her fortunes changed in 1430 when she was captured during a military campaign near Compi\u00e8gne. The Burgundians, allies of the English, sold her to the English forces. Joan was tried for heresy and witchcraft in a politically charged trial orchestrated by the English and their allies, ultimately leading to her execution by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen. \n\nDespite her tragic end, Joan of Arc became a symbol of French unity and nationalism. Her legacy endured, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. Today, she is",

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc first heard the voices that she believed were guiding her mission in 1425, when she was around 13 years old. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a peasant girl born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France. The voices she claimed to hear were said to be those of Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, who instructed her to support Charles VII in his quest to reclaim the French throne from English occupation during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe context of her visions is significant. France was embroiled in a protracted conflict with England, which had begun in 1337 and was marked by a series of battles, political intrigue, and shifting allegiances. By the time Jeanne began hearing her voices, the situation for the French was dire. The English had captured significant territories, including Paris, and Charles VII, the rightful heir to the throne, was struggling to gain recognition and support.\n\nJeanne's experiences began in her childhood, but it was in 1425 that she felt a clear call to action. According to her own accounts, the voices instructed her to lead the French army and help Charles VII be crowned at Reims. This divine mission took on a sense of urgency as she believed that her actions could turn the tide of the war in favor of the French.\n\nIn 1429, at the age of 17, Jeanne managed to secure an audience with Charles VII at the court in Chinon. Despite initial skepticism from the nobility surrounding him, she convinced him of her divine mission and was granted the opportunity to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans, a critical stronghold under English control. Her presence and leadership inspired the French troops, and the siege was successfully lifted in May 1429, marking a significant turning point in the war.\n\nJeanne's impact was not only military; she became a symbol of hope and national identity for the French people. Her faith and determination galvanized the French forces, leading to a series of victories that ultimately resulted in Charles VII's coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event was a culmination of her mission and solidified her status as a national heroine.\n\nHowever, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically after the French suffered a setback at the Battle of Paris in 1430. She was captured by Burgundian forces, allies of the English, during a skirmish near Compi\u00e8gne in May 1430. Subsequently, she was handed over to the English and put on trial for charges that included heresy and cross-dressing, as she wore male military attire.

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc led French troops to victory at the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429. The significance of this battle was that it marked a turning point in the Hundred Years' War, boosting French morale and paving the way for the coronation of Charles VII as king of France. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which took place from April 12 to May 8, 1429. Her arrival in Orl\u00e9ans was met with hope and fervor, as the city had been under siege by English forces for nearly seven months. Jeanne's presence was not only strategic but also symbolically powerful, as she claimed to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France. \n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans was significant for several reasons beyond just a military victory. First, it was a crucial moment in the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France that had begun in 1337. The French had suffered a series of defeats, and the morale of both the military and the populace had plummeted. Jeanne's leadership and the subsequent victory at Orl\u00e9ans revitalized French hopes and inspired a sense of national identity. This battle marked a turning point that shifted the momentum in favor of the French forces.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc continued to lead French troops in a series of offensives that culminated in the coronation of Charles VII at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event was highly significant, as it legitimized Charles's claim to the throne and symbolized the unity of the French people under a single monarch. The coronation at Reims, a traditional site for French kings, was a powerful act of national pride and reaffirmed the divine right of kings, which Jeanne had championed.\n\nMoreover, Jeanne's influence extended beyond the battlefield. She became a national heroine and a symbol of resistance against foreign occupation. Her faith and determination resonated deeply with the French people, and her story contributed to the burgeoning sense of French nationalism that would grow in the years to follow.\n\nDespite her successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically after the Battle of Patay, where French forces achieved another significant victory. In 1430, she was captured by Burgundian forces during a military campaign and subsequently handed over to the English. Her trial and execution in 1431, where she was charged with heresy and witchcraft, turned her into a martyr. The aftermath of her death saw her legacy grow, as she was posthumously exonerated in 1456 and canonized by the Catholic Church in 1920.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's impact on French history is profound. She is celebrated not only as a military leader but also as a symbol of courage, faith, and national unity. Today, she is recognized as one of the",

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc was ultimately captured during a military engagement at Compi\u00e8gne in May 1430, where she was betrayed by allies and handed over to the Burgundians, who sold her to the English. She was tried on charges including heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (for wearing male military attire). The trial aimed to discredit her and undermine the legitimacy of Charles VII's claim to the French throne, as she had played a crucial role in rallying support for him. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a pivotal figure during the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Her capture at Compi\u00e8gne on May 23, 1430, marked a significant turning point in her life and the war. The circumstances of her capture were particularly tragic; while leading a military campaign, she and her forces were ambushed. The betrayal came from within her own ranks, as the Burgundians, who were allied with the English, seized the opportunity to capture her. After her capture, she was sold to the English, who were eager to quash her influence and the morale she had instilled in the French forces.\n\nJeanne was put on trial in Rouen, the English-held capital of Normandy, in early 1431. The charges against her were numerous and included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing. The accusation of cross-dressing was particularly significant, as it was not merely a matter of attire; it symbolized her defiance of traditional gender roles and societal norms of the time. By wearing male clothing, she had asserted her authority and leadership in a predominantly male military environment, which threatened the established order.\n\nThe trial was politically motivated, orchestrated by the English and their allies to delegitimize Jeanne\u2019s role in the French resurgence and to undermine the legitimacy of Charles VII, whom she had helped to crown at Reims in July 1429. Jeanne's visions and claims of divine guidance had galvanized French troops and inspired a nationalistic fervor, making her a formidable symbol of hope for the French people. The trial was conducted by a pro-English ecclesiastical court, and it was riddled with irregularities and biases. Jeanne was interrogated extensively, and her responses were often taken out of context to support the charges against her.\n\nDespite her valiant defense and her unwavering conviction in her divine mission, Jeanne was ultimately found guilty. On May 30, 1431, she was burned at the stake in Rouen at the age of 19. Her trial and execution were intended to serve as a warning to others who might challenge the English authority in France. However, her martyrdom only solidified her status as a national heroine. In 1456, a retrial declared her innocent, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920.
