      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and help drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role in revitalizing French morale, leading to significant victories, including the lifting of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, and ultimately facilitated Charles VII's coronation as king. She was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, handed over to the English, and executed in 1431. Her legacy as a national heroine and martyr endures in French history. Jeanne d'Arc, known in English as Joan of Arc, was a pivotal figure in the history of France and the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, Jeanne grew up during a tumultuous time marked by English occupation and internal strife within France. Her early life was characterized by a strong sense of faith and a deep connection to the Catholic Church, which would later shape her mission.\n\nAt the age of 13, Jeanne began experiencing visions and hearing voices that she believed were divine messages from saints such as Michael, Catherine, and Margaret. These visions urged her to take action to support Charles VII, the Dauphin (heir apparent) of France, and to expel the English forces from French territory. In 1428, at the age of 16, Jeanne made her way to the court of Charles VII in Chinon, where she successfully convinced him of her divine mission. Her determination and conviction inspired those around her, leading to her official appointment as a military leader.\n\nJeanne's most notable military achievement came in 1429 with the lifting of the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, a critical stronghold for the English. The siege had lasted for several months, and its fall would have had dire consequences for the French. With her leadership, the French forces launched a series of attacks that culminated in the English retreat on May 8, 1429. This victory was a turning point in the war, revitalizing French morale and rallying support for Charles VII.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This coronation was significant not only for Charles but also for the legitimacy of his reign, as it symbolized the divine approval of his kingship, which Jeanne had always claimed was part of her mission. The ceremony was a moment of triumph for Jeanne and the French, as it marked a resurgence of hope and national pride.\n\nHowever, Jeanne's fortunes changed in 1430 when she was captured during a military campaign at Compi\u00e8gne. The Burgundians, who were allied with the English, seized her and sold her to the English forces. Her capture marked a tragic turn in her story, as she was subjected to a politically motivated trial. The English sought to discredit her and undermine the legitimacy of Charles VII's reign by portraying her as a heretic and a witch. The trial, which began in early 1431, was fraught with irregularities and was heavily influenced by the political context of the time.\n\nDespite her attempts to defend herself and her faith, Jeanne was found guilty and was sentenced to death. On May 30, 1431, she was burned at the stake in Rouen at the age of 19. Her execution shocked many and sparked outrage among the French populace, further solidifying her status as a martyr. In 1456, a posthumous retrial declared her innocent of all charges, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy extends far beyond her military accomplishments and tragic end. She became a symbol of French nationalism and unity, representing the struggle against oppression and the fight for justice. Her story has inspired countless works of art, literature, and popular culture, including plays, films, and operas. Jeanne is often depicted as a courageous and devout figure, embodying the virtues of bravery, faith, and sacrifice.\n\nIn addition to her status as a national heroine, Jeanne d'Arc is also an important figure in discussions about gender and power. In a time when women were largely excluded from public life and military affairs, her rise to prominence challenges traditional gender roles. Jeanne's leadership and military prowess demonstrate that women could play significant roles in historical events, and her story has inspired feminist movements and discussions about women's rights.\n\nToday, Jeanne d'Arc is commemorated in various ways throughout France and the world. Statues, monuments, and museums dedicated to her life and legacy can be found in many cities. The annual celebration of her feast day on May 30 is observed in France, where she is honored for her contributions to the nation. Furthermore, her image has been used in various political and social movements, often as a symbol of resistance against tyranny and injustice.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc was not only a military leader who played a significant role in the Hundred Years' War but also a cultural and historical icon whose story continues to resonate with people around the world. Her life exemplifies the complexities of faith, nationalism, and the struggle for justice, making her a timeless figure in the annals of history.

Her trial was politically motivated, aiming to delegitimize her role in the war. \n\nLater, she was exonerated in a retrial in 1456. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is a pivotal figure in French history, celebrated for her role during the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Her life was marked by extraordinary events that ultimately led to her trial and execution, each of which was deeply intertwined with the political and social landscape of 15th-century France.\n\n1. **Military Successes (1429)**: Jeanne d'Arc emerged in a time of national despair, as France was suffering under English occupation and internal strife. Her most significant military achievement was the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in April 1429. Jeanne, believing she was guided by divine visions, convinced Charles VII to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege. Her presence invigorated the troops, and the French forces achieved a remarkable victory on May 8, 1429. This success not only lifted the siege but also paved the way for Charles VII's coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429, solidifying his claim to the throne and boosting French morale. Jeanne's military exploits transformed her into a national heroine and symbol of resistance against English domination.\n\n2. **Capture (1430)**: Following her initial successes, Jeanne continued to fight for Charles VII, participating in various military campaigns. However, her fortunes changed dramatically in May 1430 when she was leading a military operation near Compi\u00e8gne. During a skirmish, she was surrounded by Burgundian troops, allies of the English, and was captured on May 23, 1430. Her capture was a significant blow to the French cause, as she had become a rallying point for the French forces and a symbol of hope for the nation.\n\n3. **Handing Over to the English**: After her capture, Jeanne was held by the Burgundians, who recognized the political implications of her imprisonment. They sold her to the English in December 1430, who were eager to undermine her influence and discredit her role in the war. The English saw Jeanne not only as a military threat but also as a potent symbol of French nationalism. They sought to use her trial as a means to demoralize the French and assert their dominance in the ongoing conflict. The English authorities aimed to portray her as a heretic and a witch, thus delegitimizing her contributions to the war effort.\n\n4. **Trial (1431)**: Jeanne's trial began in January 1431 and was conducted by an ecclesiastical court in Rouen, under the authority of Bishop Pierre Cauchon, who was aligned with the English. The charges against her included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, the latter primarily due to her wearing male military attire, which was seen as a violation of contemporary gender norms and ecclesiastical law. The trial was heavily politicized; the court sought to prove that Jeanne's claims of divine guidance were false and that she was a dangerous influence on the French people. The proceedings were marked by a lack of fairness and legal representation, as Jeanne faced a court that had already predetermined her guilt. Despite her articulate defense and steadfast faith, she was ultimately found guilty.\n\n5. **Execution (May 30, 1431)**: On the morning of May 30, 1431, Jeanne d'Arc was executed by burning at the stake in Rouen. Her execution was a public spectacle, intended to serve as a warning to others and to reinforce English control over France. Even in her final moments, Jeanne maintained her faith, reportedly calling out to God and expressing her belief in her mission. Her death was not the end of her legacy; instead, it sparked outrage among her supporters and further galvanized the French resistance against English rule.\n\n6. **Posthumous Rehabilitation (1456)**: Jeanne's trial and execution were politically motivated, and the circumstances surrounding her death led to calls for a retrial. In 1456, a posthumous retrial was conducted by the Catholic Church, which ultimately exonerated her of all charges, declaring her a martyr. This retrial highlighted the injustices of her original trial and the political motivations behind it. Jeanne's reputation was restored, and she became a symbol of French unity and nationalism.\n\n7. **Canonization (1920)**: Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church on May 16, 1920, recognizing her as a figure of faith and courage. Her canonization further solidified her status as a national heroine in France, and she became a patron saint of soldiers and France. Her legacy continues to be celebrated in various forms, including literature, art, and film, reflecting her enduring impact on French culture and identity.\n\n8. **Cultural Impact**: Jeanne d'Arc's story has transcended her historical context, inspiring countless works of art, literature, and drama. From Shakespeare's plays to modern films, her life has been interpreted in various ways, often highlighting themes of faith, patriotism, and the struggle for justice. Her image as a warrior saint resonates with many, symbolizing the fight against oppression and the power of individual conviction.\n\n9. **Modern Commemoration**: Today, Jeanne d'Arc is commemorated in France and around the world. Her feast day is celebrated on May 30, and various monuments and statues honor her legacy. The city of Orl\u00e9ans holds annual festivals to celebrate her role in the liberation of the city, and her image is often used in discussions about national identity and female empowerment. Jeanne d'Arc remains a powerful symbol of courage and resilience, inspiring future generations to stand up for their beliefs and fight against injustice.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc's trial and execution were the culmination of a series of key events influenced by military success, political intrigue, and religious politics. Her legacy endures as a testament to her unwavering faith and determination, making her one of history's most iconic figures. Key events leading to Jeanne d'Arc's trial and execution include:\n\n1. **Military Successes (1429)**: Jeanne d'Arc emerged in a time of national despair, as France was suffering under English occupation and internal strife.

Her most notable military victories, particularly at Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, marked a turning point in the conflict and had profound implications for French morale and national identity.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans began in October 1428 when English forces, led by the Earl of Salisbury, sought to capture this strategically vital city. The siege was a critical point in the war, as Orl\u00e9ans was a key stronghold for the French and its fall would have opened the way for the English to advance further into France. By the spring of 1429, the situation for the French was dire. The morale of the French troops and civilians was low, and the English seemed poised to dominate the region.\n\nJeanne d'Arc arrived at Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, having convinced Charles VII of her divine mission to support him and liberate France.

They helped to stabilize Charles VII's reign, which had been marred by internal strife and the ongoing war with England. By securing his coronation, Jeanne not only legitimized his rule but also strengthened his position against rival factions within France. Her influence extended to military strategy as well; her faith in the potential of the French forces encouraged a more aggressive stance against the English, leading to further successes in the following years.\n\nThe aftermath of the victories at Orl\u00e9ans and Reims also saw a shift in the conduct of the war. With renewed morale, the French launched a series of offensives that gradually pushed the English back. The successes inspired other French leaders and soldiers, leading to a more cohesive and determined military effort. The French forces began to adopt more effective tactics and strategies, which would ultimately contribute to the eventual expulsion of the English from most of France by the end of the war.\n\nHowever, Jeanne's fortunes would change dramatically after these victories. In May 1430, she was captured by Burgundian forces during a military campaign in Compi\u00e8gne. Her subsequent trial and execution in 1431 marked a tragic turn in her story.

Her image was used to inspire future generations in their struggles, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920.\n\nIn conclusion, Jeanne d'Arc's victories at Orl\u00e9ans and her role in the coronation of Charles VII were not only significant military achievements but also pivotal moments that transformed French morale and national identity. They galvanized the French people and military, instilling a sense of hope and purpose in their fight against English occupation.
