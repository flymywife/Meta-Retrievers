      "text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and help drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a pivotal role by leading French forces to several important victories, most notably the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which boosted French morale and paved the way for Charles VII's coronation. Her actions significantly influenced the course of the war, although she was captured by the English and executed in 1431. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France. From a young age, she claimed to have received divine visions and messages from saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These visions urged her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to reclaim French territory from English occupation during the ongoing conflict known as the Hundred Years' War, which had been raging since 1337.\n\nJoan's journey to prominence began in 1429 when she convinced Charles VII of her divine mission. Despite her humble background and lack of military experience, she was granted an army and given the opportunity to lead troops to Orl\u00e9ans, which was under siege by English forces. The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, lasting from October 1428 to May 1429, was a crucial turning point in the war. Joan arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429 and quickly inspired the French troops with her fervor and determination. Under her leadership, the French forces launched a series of successful attacks against the English, culminating in a decisive victory on May 8, 1429. This victory not only lifted the siege but also revitalized French morale and shifted the momentum of the war in favor of the French.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan continued to advocate for Charles VII's coronation in Reims, which was traditionally the site of French royal coronations. She played a key role in escorting Charles and his army to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429, taking the name Charles VII. This event was significant as it symbolized the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and united the French people under his rule, bolstering their resistance against English domination.\n\nDespite her early successes, Joan's fortunes changed dramatically in May 1430 when she was captured by Burgundian forces at Compi\u00e8gne. The Burgundians, allies of the English, sold her to the English, who sought to discredit her and undermine the French cause. Joan was put on trial for charges that included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (for wearing male military attire). The trial was politically motivated, conducted by pro-English clergy, and aimed at tarnishing her reputation and that of Charles VII.\n\nOn May 30, 1431, after a controversial trial, Joan was burned at the stake in Rouen at the age of 19. Her death was a tragic end to her remarkable life, but it did not extinguish her legacy. In 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, recognized for her courage and her unwavering faith. Today, Joan of Arc is celebrated as a national heroine of France, symbolizing bravery, faith, and the"

      "text": "Key events leading to Jeanne d'Arc's capture and trial include:\n\n1. **Siege of Compi\u00e8gne (1430)**: Jeanne d'Arc led French forces in an attempt to lift the siege but was surrounded by Burgundian troops.\n2. **Capture (May 23, 1430)**: Jeanne was captured during a skirmish as she attempted to break through enemy lines.\n3. **Betrayal**: She was sold to the English by the Burgundians, who sought to profit from her capture.\n4. **Trial (1431)**: Jeanne was put on trial by the English and their allies, facing charges of heresy and witchcraft, ultimately leading to her execution. Following the key events you've mentioned, it is essential to delve deeper into the context surrounding Jeanne d'Arc's capture and trial to understand the political and social dynamics at play during this tumultuous period in French history.\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Jeanne d'Arc, also known as the Maid of Orl\u00e9ans, emerged during the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France over territorial claims and the French crown. Her rise to prominence began in 1429 when she claimed to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and help drive the English out of France. Her leadership during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans was pivotal, as it marked a turning point in the war, boosting French morale and leading to Charles VII's coronation in Reims.\n\n2. **Siege of Compi\u00e8gne**: The siege was a critical moment in Jeanne\u2019s military career. Attempting to lift the siege on Compi\u00e8gne, she led a contingent of troops against the Burgundians, who were allied with the English. Despite her previous successes, the French forces were unable to breach the Burgundian defenses, leading to Jeanne's encirclement and eventual capture. This event underscored the precarious nature of her military endeavors and the vulnerability of the French forces at that time.\n\n3. **Capture and Betrayal**: Jeanne's capture on May 23, 1430, was a result of a strategic miscalculation during a sortie to relieve the besieged city. The Burgundians, recognizing her significance, seized the opportunity to capture the figure who had become a symbol of French resistance. Her subsequent sale to the English highlights the treacherous political landscape, where alliances were often fluid, and personal loyalties were easily compromised for political gain. The English, seeing her as a threat to their control over France, sought to discredit her.\n\n4. **Trial and Charges**: Jeanne\u2019s trial began in January 1431 and was conducted by a pro-English ecclesiastical court in Rouen. The charges against her included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (for wearing male military attire). The trial was heavily biased, with the intention of undermining her legitimacy and portraying her as a heretic rather than a national hero. The proceedings were marked by irregularities, including the lack of proper legal representation for Jeanne and the use of coercive tactics to extract confessions.\n\n5. **Execution (May 30, 1431)**: Jeanne was ultimately found guilty and burned at the stake, a martyrdom that would later elevate her status in French history. Her execution was politically motivated, serving to demoralize French forces and reinforce English claims to the"

She believed she was chosen by God to lead France against English occupation during the Hundred Years' War. This conviction drove her to seek an audience with Charles VII, convince him to allow her to lead troops, and inspire soldiers with her faith. Her unwavering belief in her mission shaped her leadership, strategic decisions, and ultimately her martyrdom, as she remained steadfast in her convictions even in the face of trial and execution.\n\nJeanne's visions began when she was around 13 years old, and she claimed to have received messages from saints such as Michael, Catherine, and Margaret. These religious experiences were not only personal but also deeply rooted in the socio-political context of her time. The French were suffering from the prolonged conflict with England, and Jeanne's belief that she was divinely appointed to restore the French crown resonated with the nationalistic sentiments of her contemporaries. Her faith provided a sense of hope and purpose in a time of despair, and she became a symbol of resistance against foreign domination.\n\nWhen Jeanne first approached Charles VII in 1429, her confidence, bolstered by her spiritual convictions, was instrumental in persuading him to allow her to lead an army to relieve the besieged city of Orl\u00e9ans.

After her capture by the Burgundians in 1430, Jeanne was handed over to the English. During her trial, she faced intense pressure to recant her claims of divine guidance. Despite the threat of execution, she maintained her innocence and her visions, asserting that she had acted under God's command. Her refusal to abandon her faith and her mission, even in the face of death, solidified her status as a martyr. \n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy extends beyond her military achievements; she became a symbol of courage, faith, and national identity for France.
