      "best_answer_key": "answer_2",
      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen employs irony and social commentary to critique and illuminate the rigid gender roles and class distinctions of early 19th-century England. Through her characters and their interactions, she highlights the limitations placed on women, who often lack economic independence and agency. For example, her use of irony reveals the absurdities of social norms and the expectations placed on women to marry for status rather than love. By depicting the struggles of her heroines within a patriarchal society, Austen underscores the complexities of identity and social mobility",

Time becomes elastic, as past and present intermingle, reflecting the complexities of human memory and perception. Consequently, character development is depicted as a dynamic, evolving process rather than a fixed trajectory, highlighting the interconnectedness of thoughts",
