      "best_answer_key": "answer_4",
      "best_answer_text": "George Orwell's experiences as a soldier in the Spanish Civil War and as a journalist in various contexts profoundly influenced his exploration of totalitarianism and individual freedom in \"1984\" and \"Animal Farm.\" \n\n1. **Firsthand Experience of Totalitarianism**: Orwell witnessed the rise of authoritarian regimes, particularly Stalinist Russia, which shaped his understanding of oppressive governance. This is reflected in the oppressive Party in \"1984\" and the corrupt leadership in \"Animal Farm.\"\n\n2. **Critique of Propaganda**: His journalistic background made him acutely aware of the power of language and propaganda, evident in \"1984\" through Newspeak and the manipulation of truth, and in \"Animal Farm\" with Squealer\u2019s deceptive rhetoric.\n\n3. **Empathy for the Individual**: Orwell's experiences fostered a deep empathy for the struggles of the individual against oppressive systems. This is a central theme in both works, highlighting the loss of personal freedom and the dehumanizing effects",
