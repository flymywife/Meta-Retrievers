      "text": "William Shakespeare's use of iambic pentameter significantly influenced English poetry and drama during the Elizabethan era by establishing a rhythmic structure that enhanced the emotional depth and lyrical quality of his works.

Shakespeare's mastery of this form enabled him to convey complex characters and themes, contributing to the evolution of character-driven narratives.

      "text": "George Orwell's experiences in the Spanish Civil War profoundly influenced his views on totalitarianism, which are evident in his works '1984' and 'Animal Farm.'

      "text": "Virginia Woolf's innovative narrative techniques in novels like 'Mrs. Dalloway' and 'To the Lighthouse' significantly contributed to the modernist literary movement by employing stream-of-consciousness and free indirect discourse.

      "text": "Emily Bront\u00eb's novel 'Wuthering Heights,' published in 1847, challenged Victorian literary conventions through its unconventional narrative structure and complex characterizations.
