      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "William Shakespeare's use of iambic pentameter significantly shaped English drama by introducing a rhythmic structure that mirrored natural speech, enhancing the emotional resonance of his characters' dialogues. This metrical form allowed for a blend of poetic elegance and dramatic urgency, making the language more accessible and engaging for audiences. \n\nAdditionally, Shakespeare's innovative character development marked a departure from the archetypal figures common in earlier plays. He crafted complex, multidimensional characters who grappled with internal conflicts and moral dilemmas, such as Hamlet's indecision or Lady Macbeth's ambition. This depth provided a more relatable and psychologically rich experience for viewers, allowing them to explore themes of ambition, love, and betrayal in a nuanced way. \n\nTogether, these elements not only elevated the standard of theatrical writing but also laid the groundwork for modern character-driven narratives in drama, influencing countless playwrights in subsequent eras",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_2",
      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen's novels critically examined the societal norms of the late 18th and early 19th centuries, particularly regarding gender and class. Through her heroines\u2014often intelligent and independent women\u2014Austen challenged the expectation that women should prioritize marriage over personal fulfillment. Characters like Elizabeth Bennet in \"Pride and Prejudice\" and Emma Woodhouse in \"Emma\" defy traditional gender roles by asserting their agency and expressing desires for love and respect rather than merely conforming to societal pressures.\n\nAusten also scrutinized class distinctions and the rigid social hierarchy of her time. In novels like \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Mansfield Park,\" she depicts the complexities of wealth and morality, illustrating that true character transcends social status. By highlighting the limitations imposed by class and gender, Austen not only provided a critique of her contemporaneous society but also laid the groundwork",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_5",
      "best_answer_text": "Virginia Woolf's use of stream-of-consciousness narrative significantly revolutionized modernist literature by capturing the intricacies of human thought and perception. Unlike traditional narrative styles, which often followed linear plots and clear character development, Woolf's writing\u2014exemplified in works like \"Mrs. Dalloway\" and \"To the Lighthouse\"\u2014immersed readers in the characters' inner experiences. This technique allowed her to explore complex themes such as time, memory, and identity, reflecting the fluid nature of consciousness. Woolf's innovative approach encouraged other modernist writers to experiment with narrative structure, focusing on subjective experiences and the nuances of reality rather than mere external events. Her mastery of this form contributed to a broader literary movement that sought to represent the complexities of modern life, marking a significant departure from Victorian norms and influencing many authors in the 20th century.",
