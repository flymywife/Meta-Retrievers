His leadership during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 and his support for the Constitution's ratification were crucial in garnering public trust and acceptance.\n\nWashington also set important precedents for the presidency itself. He established the tradition of a two-term limit, voluntarily stepping down after his second term, which set a standard that would last until the 22nd Amendment was ratified in 1951.

This guidance shaped American foreign policy for years to come and reflected his desire to keep the young nation out of European conflicts.\n\nWashington also played a pivotal role in the establishment of the nation's financial system. He supported Alexander Hamilton's financial plan, which included the federal assumption of state debts and the creation of a national bank. This laid the groundwork for a stable economy and demonstrated the federal government's ability to manage financial matters effectively.\n\nAdditionally, Washington's leadership during the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 showcased his commitment to upholding federal authority. By sending federal troops to quell the uprising, he reinforced the principle that the government had the right to enforce its laws, thereby strengthening the rule of law in the new nation.\n\nOverall, Washington's presidency was characterized by his efforts to unify the nation, establish a functional government, and set enduring preced",
