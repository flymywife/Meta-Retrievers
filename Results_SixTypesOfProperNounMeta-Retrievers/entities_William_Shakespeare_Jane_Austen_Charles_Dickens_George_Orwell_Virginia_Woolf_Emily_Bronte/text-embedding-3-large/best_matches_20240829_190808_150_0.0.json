      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "William Shakespeare's use of iambic pentameter significantly influenced English poetry and drama during the Renaissance by establishing a rhythmic and metrical framework that became a standard for subsequent writers. This five-foot line, with its alternating unstressed and stressed syllables, allowed for a natural flow of speech, enhancing the emotional depth and expressiveness of his characters. Shakespeare's mastery of this form enabled him to blend poetic language with dramatic dialogue, making his works more accessible and engaging. His innovative use of iambic pentameter also inspired later poets and playwrights, solidifying its role as a foundational element in English literature and shaping the evolution of poetic forms in the centuries that followed.",

      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen's novels, particularly \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"Sense and Sensibility,\" challenged the social norms of the early 19th century by critiquing the limited roles available to women and the institution of marriage. Austen portrayed her female protagonists as intelligent and independent, emphasizing their right to choose partners based on love and mutual respect rather than economic necessity or social status. For instance, Elizabeth Bennet's rejection of Mr. Collins highlights her desire for personal agency over societal expectations. Additionally, Austen's exploration of marriage as a complex social contract rather than a mere economic arrangement encouraged readers to reconsider the motivations behind marital unions, ultimately advocating for women's autonomy and emotional fulfillment within the constraints of her time.",
