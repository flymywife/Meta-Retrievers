      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "William Shakespeare's use of iambic pentameter significantly influenced English poetry and drama during the Elizabethan era by establishing a rhythmic structure that enhanced the emotional depth and lyrical quality of his works. This meter, consisting of five iambs (unstressed-stressed syllable pairs) per line, allowed for a natural flow of speech, making dialogue more engaging and accessible to audiences. Shakespeare's mastery of this form enabled him to convey complex characters and themes, contributing to the evolution of character-driven narratives. Furthermore, his innovative variations within iambic pentameter, such as the use of enjambment and caesura, enriched the poetic texture of his plays and sonnets, setting a standard that influenced subsequent generations of poets and playwrights",

During the war, Orwell witnessed the rise of Stalinist repression within the anti-fascist factions, particularly the betrayal of revolutionary ideals by the Soviet-backed communists. This experience led him to recognize the dangers of totalitarian regimes that manipulate truth and suppress dissent.\n\nIn 'Animal Farm,' Orwell uses allegory to critique the corruption of socialist ideals and the emergence of a dictatorial leadership, mirroring his observations of the Spanish conflict. '1984' reflects his fears of pervasive surveillance, propaganda, and the obliteration of individual freedoms, stemming from his firsthand encounters with ideological manipulation and political",
