      "best_answer_text": "George Orwell's experiences in the Spanish Civil War profoundly influenced his views on totalitarianism, which are evident in both '1984' and 'Animal Farm.' While fighting for the POUM (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification), he witnessed the betrayal of revolutionary ideals by Stalinist forces, leading to a deep skepticism of authoritarian regimes. This experience informed his portrayal of oppressive governments in '1984,' where surveillance and manipulation suppress individual freedom. In 'Animal Farm,' he critiques the corruption of socialist ideals, illustrating how revolutionary leaders can become indistinguishable from the tyrants they replace.

In 'Mrs. Dalloway,' Woolf captures the inner thoughts and perceptions of characters, blurring the lines between past and present, which reflects the complexities of human consciousness. Similarly, 'To the Lighthouse' uses shifting perspectives and fragmented time to explore themes of memory and existence. These techniques challenge traditional narrative structures, emphasizing subjective experience and the fluidity of time, hallmark characteristics of modernist literature that sought to represent",

The novel explores themes of revenge as Heathcliff's relentless pursuit of vengeance against those who wronged him drives the plot, showcasing the darker sides of human nature. Additionally, the use of a non-linear narrative and multiple perspectives breaks from the era's preference for straightforward storytelling, allowing for a deeper exploration of psychological and emotional turmoil.",
