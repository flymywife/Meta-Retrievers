      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, transformed the Civil War's purpose by making the abolition of slavery a central goal alongside preserving the Union. It declared freedom for all enslaved people in Confederate-held territory, which aimed to weaken the Confederacy's war effort by depriving it of labor. The Proclamation also allowed for the enlistment of Black soldiers in the Union Army, bolstering its numbers and morale. While it did not immediately free all enslaved individuals, it set a precedent for future legislation, leading to the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery throughout the United States, fundamentally altering the nation's social and legal landscape.",
