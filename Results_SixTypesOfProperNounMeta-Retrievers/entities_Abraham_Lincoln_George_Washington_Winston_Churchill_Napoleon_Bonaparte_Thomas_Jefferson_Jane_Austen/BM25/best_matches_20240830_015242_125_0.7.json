      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, had a significant impact on the American Civil War and the status of slavery. It declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states were to be set free, which shifted the war's focus to include the abolition of slavery as a Union goal. This proclamation weakened the Confederacy's labor force and bolstered the Union Army by allowing African Americans to enlist. It also transformed the war into a moral crusade against slavery, gaining support from abolitionists and altering international perceptions, making foreign intervention on behalf of the Confederacy less likely",

Austen portrayed her female protagonists as intelligent and capable individuals who sought personal happiness and compatibility in marriage, rather than simply conforming to societal expectations. By emphasizing the importance of love, mutual respect, and personal agency in relationships, Austen highlighted the restrictive nature of her society's views on women's roles, advocating for greater autonomy and choice in marriage",
