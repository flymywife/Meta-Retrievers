      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, transformed the Civil War's purpose by making the abolition of slavery a central goal alongside preserving the Union. It declared freedom for all enslaved people in Confederate-held territories, weakening the South's labor force and bolstering the Union's moral cause. The Proclamation also allowed for the enlistment of Black soldiers in the Union Army, further enhancing its strength. While it did not immediately free all enslaved individuals, it set a precedent for future legislation, culminating in the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_2",
      "best_answer_text": "George Washington's leadership during the American Revolutionary War was pivotal in establishing the United States as an independent nation. As Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army, he demonstrated strategic acumen, notably in the surprise victory at the Battle of Trenton and the decisive win at Yorktown, which effectively ended British military efforts. Washington's ability to maintain troop morale despite hardships, such as the winter at Valley Forge, fostered resilience and unity among the colonies. His commitment to civilian control of the military and eventual relinquishment of power set a precedent for future governance, reinforcing the principles of democracy and republicanism that would shape the new nation.",

The Code emphasized principles such as equality before the law, secular authority, and the protection of property rights. It abolished feudal privileges and established a clear legal framework that promoted individual rights. The Napoleonic Code served as a model for many European countries, leading to the adoption of similar civil codes in nations like Italy, Germany, and Spain. Its impact is evident in contemporary legal systems, where the principles of codification and uniformity remain foundational to civil law jurisdictions.",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_6",
      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen's novels critique the social norms and gender roles of the early 19th century by highlighting the limited options available to women, particularly regarding marriage and economic independence. In works like \"Pride and Prejudice\" and \"Sense and Sensibility,\" she portrays the pressure on women to secure advantageous marriages for financial security, often at the expense of personal happiness. Austen's characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet and Elinor Dashwood, challenge these norms by valuing intelligence and emotional depth over wealth and status. Through irony and social commentary, Austen exposes the absurdities of class distinctions and the constraints placed on women,",
