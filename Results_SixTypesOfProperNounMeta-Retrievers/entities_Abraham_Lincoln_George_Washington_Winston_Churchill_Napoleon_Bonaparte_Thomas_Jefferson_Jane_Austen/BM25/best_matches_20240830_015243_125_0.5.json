Ultimately, it set the stage for the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery throughout the United States, marking a significant turning point",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_5",
      "best_answer_text": "Thomas Jefferson's authorship of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 exemplified Enlightenment ideals through its emphasis on individual rights, reason, and the social contract. The document articulates the belief that all men are created equal and possess unalienable rights, such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. These principles reflect Enlightenment thinkers like John Locke, who argued for government as a protector of natural rights. Jefferson\u2019s assertion that governments derive their powers from the consent of the governed laid the groundwork for democratic governance, influencing subsequent democratic movements and constitutions worldwide, establishing a framework for accountability and representation.",
