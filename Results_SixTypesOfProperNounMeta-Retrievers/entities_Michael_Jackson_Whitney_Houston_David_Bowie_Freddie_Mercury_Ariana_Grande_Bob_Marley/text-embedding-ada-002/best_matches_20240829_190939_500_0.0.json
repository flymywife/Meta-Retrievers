These videos not only showcased Jackson's artistic vision but also set new standards for production quality and storytelling in music videos.\n\n\"Thriller,\" released in 1983, is often regarded as the most iconic music video of all time. Directed by John Landis, it featured a narrative structure, elaborate choreography, and special effects that were unprecedented for a music video at the time. The 14-minute film included a horror-themed storyline, complete with zombies and a memorable dance sequence, which captivated audiences and expanded the concept of what a music video could be. The success of \"Thriller\" helped to establish music videos as a legitimate art form and a critical marketing tool for artists. It was instrumental in the rise of MTV, which had launched in 1981 and was struggling to find content that appealed to a broader audience. Jackson's videos, particularly \"Thriller,\" became essential programming for the network, driving its popularity and viewership.\n\n\"Billie Jean,\" released in 1982, further solidified Jackson's influence on the music video landscape. The video featured groundbreaking visual techniques, including the use of lighted sidewalks that illuminated as Jackson danced. This innovative approach not only highlighted Jackson's exceptional dance skills but also set a new benchmark for visual creativity in music videos. The performance of \"Billie Jean\" on shows like \"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever\" introduced the world to Jackson's signature moonwalk dance move, which became a cultural phenomenon and a defining moment in his career.\n\nBoth \"Thriller\" and \"Billie Jean\" contributed to the integration of music and visual art, encouraging artists to invest in high-quality video production. This shift led to the emergence of music videos as a primary means of artistic expression and promotion, influencing countless artists across genres. The success of these videos also prompted record labels to allocate larger budgets for music video production, recognizing their potential to drive album sales and enhance an artist's brand.\n\nMoreover, Jackson's music videos transcended racial barriers in an industry that was often segregated. His success on MTV, a platform that initially favored white artists, opened doors for other Black artists and changed the landscape of popular music. Jackson's influence helped to pave the way for future generations of artists, making music videos a crucial aspect of an artist's career.",
