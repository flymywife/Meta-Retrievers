      "best_answer_text": "David Bowie's ability to reinvent his musical style and persona had a profound impact on the landscape of rock music and popular culture, particularly evident from the late 1960s through the 1970s. His early career saw the release of \"Space Oddity\" in 1969, but it was his transformation into Ziggy Stardust in the early 1970s that solidified his influence. This androgynous alter ego allowed Bowie to explore themes of identity, sexuality, and extraterrestrial life, pushing the boundaries of gender and self-expression in rock music.\n\nThe Ziggy Stardust character not only garnered commercial success but also inspired an entire generation of artists, encouraging them to embrace theatricality, diversity, and personal narratives within their music.
