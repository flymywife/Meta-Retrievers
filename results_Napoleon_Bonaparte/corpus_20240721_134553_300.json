Napoleon Bonaparte conducted most of his military campaigns in Europe, particularly in countries such as Italy, Austria, Prussia, and Spain. His early campaigns in Italy (1796-1797) showcased his military genius, leading to significant victories against the Austrians and establishing French dominance in the region. The subsequent campaigns against Austria in the War of the Third Coalition culminated in the decisive Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, often regarded as one of his greatest victories.\n\nIn addition to these, Napoleon's campaigns also extended to the Iberian Peninsula during the Peninsular War (1808-1814), where he faced fierce resistance from Spanish guerrillas and British forces. His invasion of Russia in 1812 marked a turning point, resulting in a catastrophic retreat that severely weakened his army.

These setbacks culminated in his abdication in 1814 and subsequent exile to Elba. His brief return to power in 1815 ended with his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo, leading to his final exile to Saint Helena.
