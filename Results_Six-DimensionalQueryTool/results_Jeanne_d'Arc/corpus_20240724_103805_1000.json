      "text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl who claimed to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and help drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role by leading French troops to several important victories, most notably the lifting of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which boosted French morale and paved the way for Charles VII's coronation. Jeanne was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, handed over to the English, tried for heresy, and burned at the stake in 1431. She became a symbol of French nationalism and later a canonized saint. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history and a symbol of courage and faith. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she grew up during a tumultuous period marked by the ongoing conflict of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. This war began in 1337 and lasted until 1453, characterized by a series of battles over territorial claims and the French crown.\n\nFrom a young age, Jeanne claimed to have experienced visions and heard voices that she believed were messages from saints, specifically Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These divine communications urged her to take action to support Charles VII, the Dauphin (heir to the French throne), and to expel the English forces from France. At the time, the English had gained significant ground, including the capture of Paris and the control of northern France, leading to despair among the French populace.\n\nIn 1429, after making her way to Charles VII's court, Jeanne convinced him of her divine mission. She was given a small army and dressed in male military attire, a choice that helped her gain credibility among soldiers and allowed her to lead them more effectively. Her most notable achievement came in April 1429 when she played a pivotal role in lifting the siege of Orl\u00e9ans, a critical stronghold for the English. This victory was not only a tactical success but also a significant morale booster for the French, who had suffered many defeats.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This event was monumental, as it symbolized the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and rallied the French people around their king. Jeanne's presence at the coronation solidified her status as a national heroine.\n\nHowever, her fortunes changed dramatically after the coronation. In May 1430, while attempting to defend Compi\u00e8gne, Jeanne was captured by the Burgundians, allies of the English. She was sold to the English and subjected to a politically motivated trial led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon, who sought to discredit her and undermine Charles VII's legitimacy. The trial accused her of heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, among other charges. Despite her strong defense and unwavering faith, she was found guilty and was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, France. Her death was a tragic loss for the French cause, but it also cemented her legacy.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's martyrdom had a profound impact on French society. Over the years, she became a symbol of resistance against oppression and a national icon. Her story inspired countless works of art, literature, and drama, including plays by George Bernard Shaw and films that depict her life and trials. In 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, further solidifying her status as a figure of faith and courage.\n\nThe Hundred Years' War continued for over two decades after Jeanne's death, but her legacy lived on. The French eventually regained control of their territory, culminating in the final victory at the Battle of Castillon in 1453. Jeanne d'Arc's life and death became emblematic of the struggle for national identity and unity in France, and she is celebrated every year on May 30, her feast day.\n\nIn modern times, Jeanne d'Arc has become a symbol of feminism and empowerment, representing the idea that an ordinary person can rise to greatness through conviction and bravery. Her story resonates with those who advocate for justice and equality, as she defied the gender norms of her time and took on roles typically reserved for men. As a result, she continues to inspire movements for social change and remains a powerful figure in both French culture and global history. \n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc was not only a key military figure in the Hundred Years' War but also a cultural and religious icon whose legacy endures to this day, embodying the spirit of resilience, faith, and national pride."

      "text": "Jeanne d'Arc first claimed to receive divine guidance in 1425, when she was around 13 years old. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history, revered for her role during the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Her claim of divine guidance began in 1425, when she was approximately 13 years old. During this time, Jeanne reported experiencing visions and hearing voices that she attributed to saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These celestial figures instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to help drive the English forces out of France.\n\nThe context of her divine revelations is crucial to understanding her motivations and the historical backdrop of her actions. The Hundred Years' War, which began in 1337, had reached a critical point by the early 15th century. The English had gained significant territory in France, including the important city of Paris, and were laying siege to Orl\u00e9ans. The French were demoralized, and the legitimacy of Charles VII's claim to the throne was in question, as he was not crowned and the English had recognized Henry VI as king of both England and France.\n\nJeanne\u2019s visions provided her with a sense of purpose and conviction. She believed that she was chosen by God to lead the French army to victory and to ensure the coronation of Charles VII at Reims, which was the traditional site for the crowning of French kings. In 1429, after gaining the support of local leaders and convincing Charles VII of her divine mission, she was granted permission to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\n\nHer presence in battle and her unwavering faith inspired the French troops, who were invigorated by her leadership. The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which lasted from October 1428 to May 1429, was a pivotal moment in the war.

She became a symbol of national unity and hope for the French people during a time of great adversity. Her courage and determination resonated deeply, and she was seen as a figure of divine intervention in a period marked by suffering and despair.\n\nHowever, her fortunes began to change after the coronation of Charles VII. The French military successes that followed were not solely due to her presence, and political machinations and military setbacks soon complicated her situation. In May 1430, Jeanne was captured by Burgundian forces during a military campaign in Compi\u00e8gne. The Burgundians were allied with the English, and her capture was a significant blow to the French cause.\n\nJeanne was handed over to the English and subjected to a politically motivated trial. The trial, which began in January 1431, was conducted by pro-English ecclesiastical authorities who sought to discredit her and her claims of divine guidance. She was charged with heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (for wearing male military attire). Despite her steadfast defense and her unwavering belief in her divine mission, she was found guilty and was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, at the age of 19.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy did not end with her tragic death. In 1456, a posthumous retrial declared her innocent of all charges, and she was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1920. Today, she is celebrated as a national heroine of France and a symbol of courage and faith. Her story has inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, and she remains a powerful figure in discussions of nationalism, gender, and religious conviction.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's life and actions continue to be studied and revered, not only for their historical significance but also for their deeper implications regarding the role of women in history, the intersection of faith and politics, and the enduring struggle for justice and recognition. Her claim of divine guidance at such a young age exemplifies how faith can inspire individuals to challenge the status quo and fight for their beliefs, leaving a lasting impact on their society and beyond.

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. Her most significant military victories, particularly at the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans and the Battle of Patay, marked turning points in the war and revitalized French morale during a time of great adversity.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which began in October 1428, was a critical confrontation in the Hundred Years' War. The English forces, led by the Duke of Suffolk, sought to capture the city to strengthen their control over the Loire Valley and further their campaign into France. The French, demoralized and fragmented, faced the prospect of losing a vital stronghold. Jeanne d'Arc arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, claiming that she had received divine guidance instructing her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and lift the siege.\n\nJeanne's presence galvanized the French troops and citizens. She inspired them with her unwavering faith and determination. On April 29, 1429, she participated in a series of assaults against the English positions, demonstrating remarkable tactical acumen. The French forces, buoyed by Jeanne's leadership, achieved a stunning victory on May 8, 1429, when they successfully lifted the siege. This victory was not only a military success but also a significant morale booster for the French, who had been reeling from a series of defeats. The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans is often seen as a turning point in the war, marking the beginning of a series of French victories that would ultimately lead to the expulsion of the English from most of France.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc played a crucial role in the subsequent Battle of Patay, which took place on June 18, 1429. This battle was significant as it was one of the first major engagements after the lifting of the siege. The French forces, now emboldened by their recent victory, faced the English army, which was led by Sir John Fastolf and Sir Thomas Remington. Jeanne, alongside her commanders, adopted a strategy that focused on mobility and surprise. The French cavalry, utilizing their knowledge of the terrain and their superior numbers, launched a swift and coordinated attack against the English forces.\n\nThe Battle of Patay resulted in a decisive French victory, with the English suffering heavy casualties and many being taken prisoner. This battle further diminished English morale and solidified Jeanne's reputation as a formidable military leader. It also paved the way for Charles VII to be crowned King of France in Reims on July 17, 1429, a crowning that Jeanne had fervently believed was part of her divine mission.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's military successes were not merely about battlefield tactics; they were deeply intertwined with her vision and faith. She claimed that her actions were divinely inspired and that she was chosen to lead France to victory and restore the rightful king to the throne. Her unwavering conviction resonated with the French populace, who saw her as a symbol of hope and national identity in a time of crisis.\n\nDespite her significant contributions, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically after the coronation of Charles VII. The French army, now emboldened, began to push the English back, but Jeanne's involvement in subsequent campaigns was limited. In May 1430, she was captured during a military engagement at Compi\u00e8gne. The Burgundians, allies of the English, sold her to the English, and she was subsequently tried for heresy and witchcraft. Jeanne was ultimately executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, at the age of 19.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy endured long after her death. She was posthumously exonerated in 1456, and in 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church. Her life and deeds have inspired countless works of art, literature, and scholarship, solidifying her status as a national heroine of France. The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans and the Battle of Patay remain emblematic of her military prowess and her role in shaping French history.
