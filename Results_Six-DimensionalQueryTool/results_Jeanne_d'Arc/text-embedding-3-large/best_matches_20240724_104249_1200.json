      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl born around 1412 who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role by leading French troops to several important victories, most notably the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which boosted French morale and helped pave the way for Charles VII's coronation as king. Her contributions were significant in revitalizing the French cause during the war. She was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, tried for heresy, and executed in 1431. Joan was later canonized as a saint in 1920. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is one of the most significant and iconic figures in French history and a symbol of national pride. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she lived during a tumultuous period characterized by the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. The war was marked by a struggle for territorial control and the French crown, with the English capturing significant territories in France.\n\nFrom a young age, Joan claimed to have received divine visions and messages from saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These visions urged her to take action to support Charles VII, the Dauphin (heir to the French throne), and to expel the English from France. At the time, Charles was struggling to claim his birthright amidst a backdrop of political instability and military defeats. Joan's conviction and faith inspired her to seek out Charles, and in 1429, she was granted an audience with him.\n\nJoan's most notable military achievement was her leadership during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429. The city had been under siege by English forces since October 1428, and its fall would have had dire consequences for the French. Joan arrived at Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429 and quickly became a symbol of hope for the besieged citizens and French troops. Her presence galvanized the French forces, and she played a pivotal role in orchestrating a series of assaults against the English. The siege was ultimately lifted on May 8, 1429, marking a turning point in the war. This victory not only boosted French morale but also legitimized Charles VII's claim to the throne.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan accompanied Charles to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This coronation was a significant moment for the French, as it symbolized the restoration of the monarchy and the unity of the French people against the English. Joan's involvement in this event solidified her status as a national heroine and a divine instrument in the eyes of many.\n\nDespite these successes, the tide of war soon turned against the French. Joan continued to fight for Charles\u2019s cause, but her fortunes changed dramatically when she was captured by Burgundian forces during a military campaign in Compi\u00e8gne in May 1430. The Burgundians, allies of the English, sold her to the English, who sought to discredit her and undermine the French cause. Joan was put on trial for heresy and witchcraft, with charges that included cross-dressing (she wore male military clothing) and claiming to receive divine revelations.\n\nThe trial was politically motivated, and the proceedings were marked by irregularities and a lack of due process. Despite her strong defense and unwavering faith, Joan was found guilty and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, France. She was only 19 years old at the time of her execution. Her death was a tragic loss for France, but it did not extinguish the spirit she had ignited among her compatriots.\n\nIn the years following her execution, Joan's legacy grew. She became a symbol of resistance and national identity for the French people. In 1456, a retrial was conducted, which declared her innocent of all charges and deemed her a martyr. This posthumous vindication contributed to her growing reputation as a saintly figure.\n\nJoan of Arc was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church on May 16, 1920. Her feast day is celebrated on May 30, the anniversary of her martyrdom. Today, she is recognized not only as a saint but also as a feminist icon and a symbol of courage and conviction. Her life and legacy have inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, and she continues to be a subject of fascination and reverence.\n\nJoan's impact on the Hundred Years' War was profound. Her leadership and faith reinvigorated the French military efforts, leading to a series of victories that ultimately culminated in the expulsion of the English from most of France. The war would continue until 1453, but Joan's contributions were pivotal in shifting the momentum in favor of the French, setting the stage for the eventual victory that restored Charles VII to power and secured the French crown.\n\nToday, Joan of Arc is celebrated not only in France but around the world, as a symbol of hope, resilience, and the power of individual conviction in the face of overwhelming odds. Her story serves as a reminder of the impact that one person can have on the course of history, inspiring generations to stand up for their beliefs and fight for justice.",

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, remains one of the most iconic figures in French history, and her life story is marked by extraordinary events that led to her trial and execution. Here\u2019s a more detailed exploration of the key events leading up to her tragic fate:\n\n1. **Military Successes (1429)**: Jeanne d'Arc emerged as a pivotal figure during the Hundred Years' War, a conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. In early 1429, she claimed to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and help him reclaim his throne. Her most significant military achievement was the lifting of the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in May 1429. This victory was crucial as it revitalized French morale and bolstered support for Charles VII, leading to his coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event symbolized a turning point in the war, as it united the French people under a legitimate monarch and inspired a wave of nationalistic fervor.\n\n2. **Capture (1430)**: Despite her earlier successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed in May 1430 when she was involved in a military campaign to relieve Compi\u00e8gne, a city besieged by Burgundians. On May 23, during a skirmish, she was surrounded and captured. Her capture was not just a military loss; it was a significant psychological blow to the French forces and a turning point in the war. The Burgundians, who were allied with the English, recognized the value of Jeanne as a prisoner and sought to exploit her for propaganda purposes.\n\n3. **Handing Over to the English**: After her capture, Jeanne was sold to the English, who were eager to discredit her and diminish the morale of the French. The English viewed her as a threat not only because of her military prowess but also due to her symbolic significance as a figure of hope for the French people. They believed that by putting her on trial for her alleged crimes, they could undermine the legitimacy of Charles VII's reign and discourage any further resistance. The English authorities sought to portray her as a heretic and a witch, which aligned with their broader strategy of demonizing the French cause.\n\n4. **Trial (1431)**: Jeanne's trial began in January 1431 and was conducted by a pro-English ecclesiastical court in Rouen, led by Bishop Pierre Cauchon. The trial was heavily biased, with the court aiming to find her guilty of heresy and witchcraft. Jeanne was accused of various charges, including wearing male clothing, claiming divine guidance, and leading troops into battle. Throughout the trial, she displayed remarkable courage and intelligence, often outsmarting her interrogators. However, the court was determined to convict her regardless of the evidence. The trial was not just a legal proceeding; it was a political maneuver designed to delegitimize her and, by extension, Charles VII.\n\n5. **Execution (May 30, 1431)**: After being found guilty of heresy, Jeanne d'Arc was sentenced to death. On May 30, 1431, she was burned at the stake in Rouen, a grim spectacle witnessed by many, including a crowd of onlookers. Her execution was intended to serve as a warning to others who might challenge English authority or claim divine inspiration. However, instead of quelling the French resistance, her martyrdom inspired a resurgence of nationalistic fervor. Within just a few years, Charles VII would go on to reclaim much of France, culminating in the eventual French victory in the Hundred Years' War.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy did not end with her death. In 1456, a retrial was conducted, which declared her innocent of all charges and recognized the injustices of her original trial. Her reputation continued to grow, and she became a symbol of French unity and nationalism. In 1920, she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, solidifying her status as a martyr and a national heroine. Today, Jeanne d'Arc is celebrated not only for her military achievements but also for her unwavering faith and courage in the face of adversity. Her story resonates through history as an emblem of resilience and the struggle for justice, inspiring countless individuals and movements for centuries. \n\nIn summary, the events leading to Jeanne d'Arc's trial and execution encapsulate a complex interplay of military, political, and religious factors during a tumultuous period in French history. Her life and legacy continue to influence contemporary discussions about faith, nationalism, and the role of women in history.",

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history, renowned for her role during the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Her claims of receiving divine visions began in 1425, when she was approximately 13 years old. These visions, which she described as messages from saints and angels, profoundly influenced her life and actions, setting her on a path that would change the course of French history.\n\nAccording to Jeanne, the first vision she experienced was a manifestation of Saint Michael, the archangel, who instructed her to support Charles VII, the rightful heir to the French throne, and to drive the English out of France. She also reported receiving guidance from other saints, including Saint Catherine and Saint Margaret, who urged her to take action in support of the French cause. This divine calling was not only a personal revelation but also a response to the dire circumstances facing France at the time, as the country was embroiled in a protracted conflict that had devastated its lands and people.\n\nJeanne's visions were initially met with skepticism, especially by the local clergy and her family. However, her faith and determination led her to seek an audience with Charles VII. In 1429, after several years of perseverance, she finally gained entry to the court at Chinon, where she convinced Charles of her divine mission. Her presence and fervor inspired the French troops, and she became a symbol of hope and resilience for the beleaguered nation.\n\nOne of the most significant moments in Jeanne's journey came in April 1429 when she played a pivotal role in lifting the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. Her leadership during this critical battle turned the tide in favor of the French forces, marking a turning point in the war. Following this victory, she accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429, fulfilling one of her primary visions and objectives.\n\nJeanne's influence extended beyond the battlefield.

The Burgundians were allies of the English, and her capture marked a tragic turn in her story.

Despite her steadfastness and eloquence in defending her actions and beliefs, Jeanne was found guilty. On May 30, 1431, she was executed by burning at the stake in Rouen, France. Her death was a brutal end to a remarkable life, but it did not extinguish her legacy.\n\nJeanne d'Arc was posthumously exonerated in 1456, thanks to a retrial that found her innocent of all charges. Her trial and execution became a rallying point for the French, and she was eventually canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. Today, she is celebrated as a national heroine of France and a symbol of courage and conviction.\n\nHer story has inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, and she remains a figure of fascination in both historical and popular culture. Jeanne d'Arc's visions, which guided her actions from a young age, exemplify the intersection of faith, nationalism, and individual agency in times of crisis. Her life continues to serve as a powerful reminder of the impact one person can have on the course of history, driven by a profound sense of purpose and belief in a cause greater than oneself. \n\nIn addition to her military and religious significance, Jeanne's story raises important questions about gender roles in history. At a time when women were often relegated to domestic spheres, her rise to prominence as a military leader challenged contemporary norms and paved the way for discussions about women's capabilities and rights in society. Her legacy endures not only in the context of French nationalism but also as a symbol of female empowerment and resilience in the face of adversity. \n\nOverall, Jeanne d'Arc's journey from a simple peasant girl in Domr\u00e9my to a revered saint and national icon illustrates the profound impact of her visions and the extraordinary circumstances that shaped her life and the history of France.

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which was a crucial turning point in the Hundred Years' War between England and France. The siege began in October 1428 and lasted until May 1429, with the English forces aiming to capture the city to solidify their control over the Loire Valley and ultimately the French crown.\n\nThe significance of the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans cannot be overstated. At the time, the French were demoralized and struggling under the weight of English occupation. The city of Orl\u00e9ans was one of the last major strongholds resisting English control, and its fall would have dire consequences for the French royal cause. Jeanne d'Arc, a peasant girl claiming to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France, arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, just as the situation was becoming increasingly desperate.\n\nOne of her most notable military achievements during this period was the Battle of the Les Tourelles, which took place on May 7, 1429. This battle was critical in the campaign to lift the siege. Jeanne d'Arc inspired the French troops with her presence and fervor, leading them into battle with a banner bearing the image of Christ and the inscription \"Jesus, Mary.\" Under her leadership, the French forces launched a surprise attack on the English fortifications at Les Tourelles, a key defensive position for the English army.\n\nThe French forces, emboldened by Jeanne's leadership and the morale boost she provided, managed to capture the fortifications after fierce fighting. This victory was not only a tactical success but also a symbolic one, as it demonstrated the potential for French forces to reclaim their territory and inspired hope among the populace and troops alike.\n\nFollowing the victory at Les Tourelles, Jeanne d'Arc continued to rally the French troops and organized further assaults on the English positions. The culmination of these efforts occurred on May 8, 1429, when the siege of Orl\u00e9ans was officially lifted. The English, realizing the tide had turned and that their position was untenable, retreated from the city. This marked a significant turning point in the Hundred Years' War, as it revitalized the French cause and bolstered the legitimacy of Charles VII's claim to the throne.\n\nJeanne's role in the liberation of Orl\u00e9ans not only elevated her to a national heroine but also solidified her status as a symbol of French resistance. After the siege, she continued to advocate for Charles VII's coronation in Reims, which was a crucial step in legitimizing his rule and uniting the fractured French kingdom. Her presence at the coronation on July 17, 1429, was a testament to her influence and the faith the French people had in her mission.\n\nDespite her successes, Jeanne d'Arc's fortunes would eventually turn. She was captured by Burgundian forces in May 1430 during a military campaign and subsequently handed over to the English. Jeanne was tried for heresy and witchcraft, a politically motivated trial aimed at discrediting her and her role in the war. She was ultimately executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the young age of 19. However, her legacy endured, and she was posthumously exonerated in 1456, and canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's impact on French history is profound. Her leadership during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans not only altered the course of the Hundred Years' War but also became a symbol of national pride and unity. She is celebrated in France as a national heroine, and her story has inspired countless works of art, literature, and drama. The events surrounding her life and military victories continue to resonate, representing themes of faith, courage, and the fight for justice.\n\nIn modern times, Jeanne d'Arc's legacy is commemorated through various monuments, festivals, and educational programs. The city of Orl\u00e9ans honors her memory with an annual celebration known as \"Joan of Arc Day,\" which includes parades, reenactments, and various cultural events that highlight her contributions to French history. Additionally, her image and story are often invoked in discussions about nationalism, women's rights, and the role of individual agency in history.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc's most significant military victories during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, particularly at the battles of Les Tourelles and the subsequent liberation of the city, were not only crucial in the context of the Hundred Years' War but also established her as an enduring symbol of hope and resistance for the French people.

Her deep religious conviction was a driving force behind her actions, and she believed that she was divinely chosen to fulfill this mission.

Her actions led to the coronation of Charles VII at Reims, reinforcing French claims to the throne and revitalizing the French resistance against English occupation. Ultimately, her contributions were pivotal in shifting momentum toward the French, contributing to their eventual victory in the war.\n\nJoan's journey began with her divine visions, which she claimed were from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and reclaim France from English domination. Her unwavering faith and conviction resonated deeply with both the common people and the soldiers, who saw her as a symbol of hope and divine favor. This was particularly significant during a time when the French were demoralized by a series of defeats and the political instability that plagued the kingdom.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, which lasted from October 1428 to May 1429, was one of the most critical confrontations of the war. The city was a strategic stronghold for the English, and its fall would have had dire consequences for the French. Joan arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, and her presence alone was enough to galvanize the French defenders. She encouraged the troops, led them into battle, and participated in the fighting. The French forces, inspired by her determination and the belief that they were fighting under divine protection, managed to lift the siege on May 8, 1429. This victory was a turning point in the war, as it not only boosted French morale but also demonstrated that the English could be defeated.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan played a crucial role in the subsequent campaign to have Charles VII crowned king. She insisted that the coronation take place at Reims, a city that held historical significance as the traditional site for French kings' anointing. In July 1429, with Joan at his side, Charles VII was crowned in Reims Cathedral. This event was monumental, as it symbolized the legitimacy of his reign and the unity of the French people against the English. The coronation was not just a political act; it was a spiritual one that reinforced the idea of divine right and the sanctity of the French monarchy.\n\nJoan's influence extended beyond the battlefield. She became a national icon and a figure of French nationalism. Her story inspired literature, art, and folklore, and she was seen as a martyr after her capture by the Burgundians in 1430. The Burgundians, who were allied with the English, sold her to the English, and she was tried for heresy in a politically motivated trial. Joan was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431. Her execution sparked outrage and further galvanized French resistance against English rule. \n\nIn the years following her death, Joan's legacy grew. In 1456, a retrial was conducted, and she was posthumously exonerated of all charges. She was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920, solidifying her status as a national heroine. Joan d\u2019Arc's life and martyrdom became emblematic of the struggle for French independence and the fight against foreign oppression. \n\nMoreover, her actions had lasting implications for the French military.
