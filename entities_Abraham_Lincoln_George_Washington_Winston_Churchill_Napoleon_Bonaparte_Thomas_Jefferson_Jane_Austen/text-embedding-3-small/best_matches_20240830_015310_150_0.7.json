      "best_answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, had a significant impact on the American Civil War and the status of slavery.

Additionally, it altered international perceptions, making it difficult for foreign nations to support the Confederacy. While the Proclamation did not immediately free all enslaved individuals, it set the stage for eventual abolition, culminating in the 13th Amendment in 186",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_6",
      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen's novels, written during the early 19th century, challenged social norms by critiquing the limited roles available to women and the institution of marriage.

Through characters like Elizabeth Bennet and Emma Woodhouse, she questioned the societal expectation that women should prioritize marriage above all else. Additionally, her narratives often highlighted the consequences of marrying for convenience or social status, advocating for personal agency and emotional fulfillment in relationships. This subtle yet powerful commentary contributed to a gradual shift in attitudes towards women's autonomy and marriage in her time.",
