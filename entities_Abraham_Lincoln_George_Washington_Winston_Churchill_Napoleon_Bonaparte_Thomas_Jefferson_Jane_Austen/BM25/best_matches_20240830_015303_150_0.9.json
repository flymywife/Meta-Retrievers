      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, had a significant impact on the American Civil War and the status of slavery. It declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states were to be set free, which reframed the war's purpose to include the abolition of slavery alongside the preservation of the Union. This shifted the Union's military strategy, allowing for the enlistment of African American soldiers, who played a critical role in the war effort. Additionally, the Proclamation weakened the Confederacy's labor force and bolstered the moral imperative of the Union cause, contributing to the eventual passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery throughout the United States.",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_6",
      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen introduced several narrative innovations that significantly influenced literature. One key aspect is her use of free indirect discourse, which allows readers to engage with a character's thoughts and feelings while maintaining an objective narrative voice. This technique enhances psychological depth and intimacy, paving the way for modern stream-of-consciousness writing.\n\nAusten also emphasized character development through detailed social interactions and moral dilemmas, enabling a nuanced exploration of personal growth. Her intricate plotting and the use of irony not only provided social commentary but also highlighted the inner lives of women, challenging the traditional portrayal of female characters. These elements have profoundly shaped the development of the modern novel, influencing writers in both character portrayal and narrative techniques.",
