      "best_answer_key": "answer_1",
      "best_answer_text": "Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued on January 1, 1863, had a profound impact on the American Civil War and the status of slavery. It declared that all enslaved people in the Confederate states were to be set free, which shifted the war's focus to include the abolition of slavery as a key objective. This executive order weakened the Confederacy's labor force, bolstered the Union's moral cause, and allowed for the enlistment of African American soldiers in the Union Army. While it did not immediately end slavery throughout the United States, it set the stage for the eventual passage of the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865, which abolished slavery nationwide.",

      "best_answer_key": "answer_6",
      "best_answer_text": "Jane Austen's novels, written in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, challenged social norms and gender roles by highlighting women's limited options and advocating for their intelligence and autonomy. Through characters like Elizabeth Bennet in \"Pride and Prejudice,\" Austen critiques the marriage market and the importance placed on wealth and status, promoting the idea of marrying for love rather than economic necessity. Her nuanced portrayals of female characters allowed for a deeper exploration of women's inner lives and desires, paving the way for modern literature that emphasizes complex female narratives. Austen's influence is evident in contemporary works that continue to examine gender dynamics and social expectations.",
