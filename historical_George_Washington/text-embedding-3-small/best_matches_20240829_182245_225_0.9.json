      "best_answer_text": "George Washington\u2019s limited formal education, which ceased around the age of 15, significantly influenced his pragmatic approach to governance and military strategy. Lacking a classical education, Washington developed a hands-on understanding of the land and resources crucial for effective leadership. His early experiences as a land surveyor provided him with skills in mapping, spatial awareness, and an appreciation for the geography of Virginia, essential factors in military logistics and strategy during his later military career.\n\nThe surveying work also exposed him to the complexities of land ownership and the interactions between settlers and Native Americans, shaping his views on property rights and territorial expansion. This background enabled him to make informed decisions about troop movements and resource allocation during the American Revolutionary War, as he could assess terrain and build effective strategies based on his knowledge of the landscape.\n\nMoreover, Washington's practical education fostered an egalitarian approach to leadership, as he valued merit and capability over formal credentials. This perspective was reflected in his inclusive leadership style, emphasizing collaboration among military leaders and later in his presidency, where he prioritized unity and the interests of the nascent nation over partisan divisions.",
