Her visions reportedly began when she was about 13 years old, and she described these experiences as divine messages from saints, including Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These saints instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to help him reclaim his throne from English occupation.\n\nJeanne's visions were significant not only for her personal faith but also for their impact on the French military and political landscape.
