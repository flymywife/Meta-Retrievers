      "text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role by leading French troops to several important victories, most notably the lifting of the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which boosted French morale and paved the way for Charles VII's coronation. She was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, handed over to the English, and executed in 1431. Joan of Arc became a symbol of French unity and nationalism. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history, revered for her courage and conviction during one of the most tumultuous periods in medieval Europe\u2014the Hundred Years' War. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she was the daughter of Jacques d'Arc and Isabelle Rom\u00e9e. Growing up in a peasant family, Joan was deeply religious and began experiencing visions and hearing voices at a young age. These visions, which she attributed to saints such as Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, urged her to take action to save France from English domination and to support Charles VII, the Dauphin and rightful heir to the French throne.\n\nThe Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453, was a series of conflicts between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, primarily over territorial disputes and claims to the French throne. By the time Joan emerged on the scene, the war had taken a severe toll on France, leading to widespread despair and a sense of hopelessness among the French populace. The English had gained significant ground, capturing important territories and even controlling the French crown.\n\nIn 1429, Joan managed to gain an audience with Charles VII, who was initially skeptical but soon became convinced of her sincerity and divine mission. She was given a small army and tasked with lifting the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, a crucial stronghold that had been under English siege since October 1428. Joan\u2019s leadership and the fervor she inspired in the troops were instrumental in the French victory at Orl\u00e9ans in May 1429. This victory was not only a military success but also a significant psychological boost for the French, rallying them around the cause of Charles VII and reigniting hope in the possibility of a French resurgence against the English.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan played a pivotal role in the subsequent campaign that led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event was significant because it symbolized the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and reinforced the idea of a divinely sanctioned monarchy. Joan was present at the coronation, wearing armor and carrying her banner, which depicted Christ and two angels. Her presence at this event solidified her status as a national heroine and a symbol of divine favor for the French cause.\n\nHowever, Joan's fortunes took a turn for the worse after the coronation. In May 1430, she participated in the military campaign to reclaim the Burgundian-held city of Compi\u00e8gne, where she was captured by Burgundian forces. The Burgundians, allies of the English, sold her to the English, who sought to discredit her and undermine the morale of the French. Joan was put on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (she wore male military attire). The trial was politically motivated, conducted by pro-English ecclesiastical authorities, and aimed at delegitimizing her influence and the French monarchy she had supported.\n\nJoan was found guilty and was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, France, at the age of 19. Her execution shocked many and generated sympathy for her cause, leading to her posthumous rehabilitation. In 1456, a retrial declared her innocent of all charges, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. \n\nJoan of Arc's legacy extends beyond her military achievements and martyrdom; she has come to represent the spirit of resistance against oppression and the belief in the possibility of change through conviction and faith. Her life story has inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, and she remains a powerful symbol of national pride in France. The impact of her actions during the Hundred Years' War contributed significantly to the eventual French victory, which culminated in the expulsion of the English from most of France by 1453. \n\nToday, Joan of Arc is celebrated as a national heroine, and her feast day is observed on May 30. Her life and legacy continue to resonate, serving as a reminder of the power of faith and determination in the face of overwhelming odds.

Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history, known for her pivotal role during the Hundred Years' War between France and England. The key events leading to her trial and execution are deeply intertwined with the political and social climate of 15th-century France.\n\n1. **Military Successes (1429)**: Jeanne d'Arc emerged as a national heroine after her extraordinary military achievements. In April 1429, she arrived at the besieged city of Orl\u00e9ans, where her presence inspired the French troops. Her strategic insights and fervent faith were credited with lifting the siege on May 8, 1429, a significant turning point in the war. Following this victory, Jeanne urged Charles VII to claim the French throne, leading to his coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event was monumental, as it symbolized the legitimacy of Charles VII's rule and reinvigorated French national pride against English occupation.\n\n2. **Capture (1430)**: Despite her earlier successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically. On May 23, 1430, during a military campaign aimed at liberating Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, allies of the English.

The Burgundians, recognizing her importance, sought to exploit her capture for political gain.\n\n3. **Handing Over to the English**: After her capture, Jeanne was sold to the English, who were eager to undermine her influence. They viewed her as a threat, not only because of her military prowess but also due to her spiritual authority among the French populace.

The trial was heavily biased, with the judges predetermined to find her guilty. The charges against her included heresy, witchcraft, and the wearing of male clothing, which was considered a violation of biblical injunctions regarding gender roles. Jeanne's defense was hampered by the court's refusal to recognize her divine visions and the legitimacy of her military actions. Notably, her cross-dressing was used as a symbol of her defiance against traditional gender norms, further fueling the prosecution's case against her.\n\n5. **Conviction and Execution**: On May 24, 1431, Jeanne was found guilty of heresy and was sentenced to death. On May 30, she was executed by burning at the stake in the marketplace of Rouen. Her execution was public and brutal, intended to serve as a warning to others who might challenge English authority or support Charles VII. Despite her tragic end, Jeanne's martyrdom only strengthened her legacy. She became a symbol of French nationalism and religious fervor, inspiring future generations.\n\nJeanne's trial was politically motivated, reflecting the intense power struggles of the time. The English sought to undermine Charles VII's legitimacy by attacking his most potent symbol of hope. The trial was marred by procedural irregularities and lacked fairness, as it was conducted under the auspices of those who had a vested interest in her condemnation.\n\nIn the years following her death, Jeanne's reputation began to shift. In 1456, a retrial was conducted, led by Cardinal de Lorraine, which exonerated her of all charges and declared her a martyr. This retrial was part of a broader effort to restore her honor and recognize her contributions to the French cause. In 1920, Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church, solidifying her status as a national and religious icon.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's legacy endures not only in France but also around the world, as she embodies themes of courage, faith, and the struggle against oppression.

      "text": "Jeanne d'Arc's visions and beliefs, which she claimed were messages from saints and divine guidance, profoundly influenced her actions and decisions. They instilled in her a strong sense of purpose and mission to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, in reclaiming his throne during the Hundred Years' War. Her conviction led her to take on a military role, rallying troops and inspiring them with her faith. These beliefs motivated her to defy societal norms for women and ultimately led to her martyrdom, as she remained steadfast in her convictions even when faced with persecution. Jeanne d'Arc's visions and beliefs were pivotal in shaping her identity and actions, serving as a driving force throughout her short but impactful life. From a young age, she reported experiencing visions and hearing voices, which she identified as those of saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These divine encounters provided her with a profound sense of purpose and a mission that transcended the expectations of her time. In a society where women were largely relegated to domestic roles, Jeanne\u2019s conviction to lead and fight was revolutionary. \n\nHer first major decision, spurred by these visions, was to seek an audience with Charles VII. At the time, Charles was struggling to assert his claim to the French throne amidst the chaos of the Hundred Years' War. Jeanne's faith in her divine mission prompted her to travel to the court at Chinon, where she boldly asserted that she could help Charles reclaim his kingdom. Her confidence and determination were infectious, and her presence began to inspire those around her, including soldiers who were demoralized by years of conflict. \n\nWhen Jeanne convinced Charles to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, it marked a significant turning point in her life and the war.

Her insistence on maintaining a moral high ground in warfare\u2014advocating for the protection of civilians and the treatment of prisoners\u2014reflected her deep-rooted convictions about justice and righteousness.\n\nHowever, Jeanne\u2019s beliefs also placed her in a precarious position. Her unwavering faith and her role as a female military leader attracted both admiration and hostility. As she gained prominence, she also faced increasing scrutiny from various factions, including those who were skeptical of her divine claims and those who viewed her as a threat to established power structures. After her capture by the Burgundians in 1430, her beliefs would become a focal point in her trial. The charges against her included heresy and witchcraft, largely stemming from her claims of divine guidance and her refusal to conform to traditional gender roles.\n\nDuring her trial, Jeanne maintained her faith and convictions, asserting that her visions were genuine and that she was chosen by God to fulfill a specific purpose. The trial was heavily politicized, with her captors seeking to discredit her and undermine her influence. Despite the intense pressure to recant her beliefs, Jeanne held firm, demonstrating remarkable fortitude in the face of impending execution. Her steadfastness ultimately led to her being branded a heretic, and she was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19.\n\nJeanne d'Arc's martyrdom transformed her into a symbol of courage and faith.
