      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was a French peasant girl born around 1412 who claimed to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France during the Hundred Years' War. She played a crucial role by leading French troops to several important victories, most notably the lifting of the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429. Her actions helped revive French morale and contributed to the eventual coronation of Charles VII as king. She was captured by the Burgundians in 1430, handed over to the English, and executed in 1431. Joan was later canonized as a saint in 1920. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, stands as one of the most iconic figures in both French history and the broader context of the Hundred Years' War, which lasted from 1337 to 1453. Born in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, around 1412, she grew up in a period marked by turmoil and conflict. The Hundred Years' War was a series of battles between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, primarily over territorial disputes and claims to the French throne.\n\nJoan's early life was steeped in the religious fervor of her time, and she claimed to have received divine visions and messages from saints such as Michael, Catherine, and Margaret. These visions, which began when she was around 13 years old, instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin (heir to the French throne), and to help liberate France from English occupation. This conviction led her to seek an audience with Charles VII in 1429, a bold move for a young peasant girl in a patriarchal society.\n\nJoan's arrival at the court of Charles VII in Chinon was met with skepticism, but her confidence and the authenticity of her claims eventually won over the Dauphin and his advisors. They allowed her to lead an army to the besieged city of Orl\u00e9ans, which was a pivotal stronghold on the Loire River. The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans had been ongoing since October 1428, and the French forces were demoralized after a series of defeats.\n\nIn April 1429, Joan arrived at Orl\u00e9ans and quickly became a symbol of hope for the French troops. Her presence inspired the soldiers, and she took part in strategic planning, urging the French commanders to adopt a more aggressive approach. On May 8, 1429, the French achieved a decisive victory, breaking the siege and forcing the English to retreat. This victory was significant not only for its military implications but also for its psychological impact on the French populace, who began to rally around the idea of a restored French monarchy.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This coronation was a critical moment for the French, as it symbolized the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and the revival of national pride. Joan's role in this event solidified her status as a national heroine, and she became a central figure in the French resistance against English rule.\n\nHowever, Joan's fortunes changed dramatically after the coronation. In May 1430, she led a military campaign to support the French forces in Compi\u00e8gne but was captured by Burgundian troops during a skirmish. The Burgundians, allied with the English, sold her to the English, who were eager to discredit her and undermine the French morale. Joan was put on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (she wore male military attire, which was viewed as inappropriate for a woman at the time).\n\nThe trial was politically motivated, orchestrated by the English and their allies to delegitimize Charles VII's reign and to diminish the spirit of resistance among the French. Joan was found guilty and was burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, at the age of approximately 19. Her execution was a tragic end to her remarkable life, but it also marked the beginning of her legacy.\n\nIn the years following her death, Joan of Arc's reputation grew, and she became a symbol of French nationalism and unity. The tide of the war turned in favor of the French, culminating in the eventual expulsion of the English from most of France by 1453. Her martyrdom and the subsequent victories were pivotal in solidifying Charles VII's reign and the restoration of the French monarchy.\n\nIn 1456, a posthumous retrial declared her innocent of the charges brought against her, affirming her status as a martyr. The Catholic Church canonized Joan of Arc as a saint on May 16, 1920, recognizing her contributions to the faith and her role in French history. Today, she is celebrated not only as a national heroine of France but also as a symbol of courage, faith, and the struggle for justice.\n\nJoan of Arc's legacy endures in various forms, including literature, art, and popular culture. She has been the subject of numerous works, from Shakespeare's plays to modern films and books, highlighting her multifaceted character. Her life story resonates with themes of faith, determination, and the fight against oppression, making her an enduring figure in both French history and global culture.\n\nMoreover, Joan of Arc's impact extends beyond her military achievements and religious significance. She serves as a powerful symbol for feminist movements and discussions around gender roles, as she defied societal norms of her time by taking on a leadership role in a male-dominated environment. Her story inspires countless individuals to stand up for their beliefs and challenge the status quo.\n\nIn contemporary society, Joan of Arc is often invoked in discussions about patriotism, sacrifice, and the complexities of war. Statues and memorials dedicated to her can be found in various locations, celebrating her bravery and the indelible mark she left on history. Her life continues to inspire new generations, reminding us of the power of conviction and the potential for ordinary individuals to effect extraordinary change. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, remains a monumental figure in both French history and the broader context of the Hundred Years' War, which spanned from 1337 to 1453. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she grew up amid the chaos and devastation wrought by this protracted conflict. The war was fundamentally a struggle for control over French territories and the rightful claim to the French throne, primarily between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France. \n\nJoan's early life was heavily influenced by the religious fervor of her time, as she was raised in a devout Catholic household. By the age of 13, she began experiencing what she believed were divine visions and voices from saints, including Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. These supernatural encounters directed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin, and to liberate France from English domination. This conviction was remarkable for a young peasant girl in a patriarchal society, where women's roles were largely confined to domestic spheres.\n\nIn 1429, Joan made the audacious decision to approach Charles VII at his court in Chinon. Initially met with skepticism, her unwavering faith and the authenticity of her claims gradually won over the Dauphin and his advisors. They ultimately permitted her to lead an army to the besieged city of Orl\u00e9ans, which was a critical stronghold on the Loire River. The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans, ongoing since October 1428, had left French forces demoralized following a series of defeats. \n\nJoan's arrival in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429 revitalized the French troops. Her presence became a beacon of hope, and she participated actively in strategic discussions, advocating for a bold approach against the English. On May 8, 1429, the French achieved a monumental victory, breaking the siege and forcing the English to retreat. This victory was significant not only for its military implications but also for its psychological impact on the French populace, who began to rally around the idea of a restored French monarchy.\n\nFollowing the triumph at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429. This coronation was a watershed moment, symbolizing the legitimacy of Charles's claim to the throne and rekindling national pride among the French people. Joan's role in this event cemented her status as a national heroine and a pivotal figure in the French resistance against English rule.\n\nHowever, the tide of war turned against Joan shortly after the coronation. In May 1430, she led a military campaign to support French forces at Compi\u00e8gne but was captured by Burgundian troops during a skirmish. The Burgundians, allied with the English, sold her to the English, who sought to undermine the French morale by discrediting Joan. She was put on trial on charges that included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, as her choice to wear male military attire was seen as an affront to gender norms of the time.\n\nThe trial was a politically motivated endeavor, orchestrated by the English and their allies to delegitimize Charles VII's reign and diminish the spirit of resistance among the French. Despite her defense, Joan was found guilty and executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, in Rouen, at the young age of approximately 19. Her tragic end marked the beginning of her enduring legacy.\n\nIn the years following her death, Joan of Arc's reputation grew exponentially, transforming her into a symbol of French nationalism and unity.

Her military successes were marked by her significant role in lifting the siege of Orl\u00e9ans in May 1429, which was a turning point in the war. This victory not only bolstered French morale but also paved the way for Charles VII's coronation in Reims on July 17, 1429. Jeanne's presence at the coronation, where she was honored as a heroine, elevated her status to a national symbol of hope and resistance against English occupation.\n\n2. **Capture (1430)**: Jeanne's fortunes began to wane during a military campaign in 1430. On May 23, while defending Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, who were allies of the English. Her capture was a significant blow to the French cause, as Jeanne had become a rallying figure for the French troops. The circumstances of her capture were dramatic; she was surrounded and, in an attempt to escape, fell from her horse and was taken prisoner. This event marked the beginning of her tragic downfall.\n\n3. **Betrayal and Sale (1430)**: After her capture, Jeanne was held by the Burgundians, who saw her as a valuable bargaining chip. They sold her to the English, who were eager to discredit her and diminish the legitimacy of Charles VII's claim to the throne. The English viewed Jeanne not just as a military leader but as a threat to their control over France.

In the years that followed, she became a symbol of national unity and resistance against oppression.\n\n6. **Posthumous Rehabilitation (1456)**: In 1456, a retrial was conducted, led by Jeanne's mother and supporters, to clear her name. This trial found her innocent of all charges and declared her a martyr. The rehabilitation was significant in restoring her reputation and recognizing the political motivations behind her original trial and execution. This posthumous vindication also reflected the changing tides in the Hundred Years' War, as Charles VII had successfully reclaimed much of France from English control.\n\n7. **Canonization (1920)**: Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church on May 16, 1920. Her canonization was a recognition of her faith, bravery, and the significant role she played in French history. She is celebrated as a patron saint of France and is often invoked in discussions of nationalism, faith, and the role of women in history. Her legacy continues to inspire countless individuals and movements, emphasizing themes of courage, conviction, and the pursuit of justice.\n\n8. **Cultural Impact**: Jeanne d'Arc's life and legacy have had a profound impact on French culture and identity. She has been the subject of numerous works of art, literature, and film, portraying her as a symbol of patriotism and female empowerment. Her story has transcended historical narrative to become a cultural icon, representing the struggle for justice and the fight against oppression. From Victor Hugo's play \"La Pucelle d'Orl\u00e9ans\" to modern films and literature, Jeanne's story resonates with themes of resilience and faith.\n\n9. **Modern Interpretations**: In contemporary discussions, Jeanne d'Arc is often viewed through various lenses, including feminist perspectives that highlight her role as a woman in a male-dominated society. Scholars explore her significance not only as a military leader but also as a figure who challenged gender norms of her time. Her visions and claims of divine guidance have also sparked interest in the intersections of faith, mental health, and the experiences of women in history.\n\n10. **Legacy of Nationalism**: Jeanne d'Arc has become a potent symbol of French nationalism. Her image has been co-opted by various political movements throughout French history, especially during times of national crisis. From the French Revolution to World War I and beyond, her legacy has been invoked to inspire unity and resilience among the French people. Statues, monuments, and national holidays celebrate her contributions, reinforcing her status as a national heroine.\n\nIn summary, the key events leading to Jeanne d'Arc's trial and execution are intertwined with the broader context of the Hundred Years' War and the political dynamics of 15th-century France. Her military successes, capture, trial, and execution reflect the complexities of power, faith, and identity in a tumultuous period.

      "best_answer_key": "answer_3",
      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc first heard the voices in 1425. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, first reported hearing the voices in 1425 when she was around 13 years old. These voices, which she believed were divine, were said to be those of saints, particularly Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret. They instructed her to support Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and to help him reclaim his throne from the English, who were occupying much of France during the Hundred Years' War.\n\nThe context of Jeanne's visions is crucial for understanding her mission. The Hundred Years' War (1337-1453) was a protracted conflict between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of France, primarily over territorial disputes and claims to the French throne. By the time Jeanne began her mission, the French were suffering significant defeats, and the legitimacy of Charles VII's claim to the throne was in question, especially after the English captured key territories, including Paris.\n\nJeanne's visions were not merely personal experiences; they were deeply intertwined with the political and social climate of France at the time. She believed that her divine guidance was a call to action, urging her to lead the French forces and support Charles VII in his quest to reclaim his kingdom. In 1429, after several years of preparation and gathering support, Jeanne successfully convinced Charles VII to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans, a critical stronghold that had been under siege by the English since October 1428.\n\nJeanne's presence at Orl\u00e9ans was pivotal. She arrived in April 1429, and her leadership and morale-boosting presence inspired the French troops. The siege was lifted on May 8, 1429, a significant turning point in the war. Following this victory, Jeanne played a crucial role in the subsequent coronation of Charles VII at Reims on July 17, 1429, which solidified his claim to the throne and marked a symbolic victory for the French.\n\nDespite her successes, Jeanne's fortunes changed dramatically in the following years. In May 1430, she was captured by Burgundian forces at Compi\u00e8gne and subsequently handed over to the English. Her trial began in January 1431, and she was charged with heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (she wore male military attire). The trial was politically motivated, aiming to discredit her and, by extension, Charles VII. Jeanne maintained her faith throughout the proceedings, insisting that her voices were from God and that she was on a divine mission.\n\nOn May 30, 1431, Jeanne was burned at the stake in Rouen, France, at the age of 19. Her death was a tragic end to her extraordinary life, but it did not extinguish her legacy. In 1456, a posthumous retrial declared her innocent of the charges against her, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. Jeanne d'Arc is now recognized as a national heroine of France and a symbol of courage, faith, and resistance.\n\nHer story has inspired countless works of literature, art, and film, highlighting her role as a young woman who defied the norms of her time. Jeanne d'Arc's life raises important questions about gender, faith, and the intersection of religion and politics. She remains a powerful figure in both French history and the broader context of women's roles in society, particularly in times of conflict.\n\nIn addition to her military achievements, Jeanne's impact on the French psyche and national identity cannot be overstated. She became a symbol of French unity and nationalism, especially during the tumultuous periods of the French Revolution and the World Wars. Her image has been used to rally people around the ideals of freedom and justice, showcasing the enduring legacy of her life and mission.\n\nJeanne's life and the circumstances surrounding her visions also invite discussions about the nature of religious experiences and how they can shape historical events. Her belief in her divine calling illustrates the profound influence that faith can have on individual actions and collective movements. The societal response to her visions\u2014both during her life and after her death\u2014reflects the complexities of belief, power, and the role of women in history.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc first heard the voices in 1425, a moment that set her on a path that would alter the course of French history. Her journey from a peasant girl in Domr\u00e9my to a national icon is a testament to her courage and the impact of her faith. Her legacy continues to resonate, inspiring discussions about leadership, spirituality, and the role of women in shaping history. Jeanne d'Arc's story is not only a remarkable tale of personal conviction and bravery but also a reflection of the socio-political landscape of 15th-century France. Born around January 6, 1412, in the small village of Domr\u00e9my, Jeanne grew up during a time when France was embroiled in the Hundred Years' War, a conflict that pitted the French against the English crown. This war had profound implications for the French monarchy and national identity, and it was against this backdrop that Jeanne's visions emerged.\n\nJeanne's visions began when she was just 13 years old, around 1425. She described hearing the voices of saints, primarily Saint Michael, Saint Catherine, and Saint Margaret, who guided her and urged her to take action. These experiences were not entirely unique; throughout history, many religious figures have claimed to receive divine messages, but Jeanne's story is particularly compelling due to her subsequent actions and the impact she had on France's destiny. The voices she claimed to hear instilled in her a sense of purpose and destiny, compelling her to seek out Charles VII, the Dauphin of France, and support his claim to the throne.\n\nIn the years leading up to Jeanne's involvement, France was in a dire situation. The English had captured significant territories, including the important city of Paris, and Charles VII's legitimacy was under siege. The French troops were demoralized, and the populace was weary of the ongoing conflict. Jeanne's arrival on the scene in 1429, particularly with her mission to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans, marked a pivotal moment in the war. Her determination and charismatic presence rallied the French soldiers, reviving their spirits and instilling hope in a beleaguered nation.\n\nJeanne's military campaigns were characterized by a blend of faith and strategy. She insisted on leading troops into battle, often donning male military attire, which was a bold statement in a time when women were expected to adhere to strict gender roles. Her leadership at Orl\u00e9ans was crucial; she not only inspired the troops but also played an active role in planning the military strategy that ultimately led to the lifting of the siege. This victory was a turning point in the war, demonstrating that the French could prevail against the English and reinvigorating support for Charles VII.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne's influence continued to grow. She accompanied Charles VII to Reims, where he was crowned king on July 17, 1429, in a ceremony that was steeped in symbolism. This coronation was not just a personal triumph for Charles; it was a validation of Jeanne's mission and a unifying moment for the French people. The sight of a crowned king, supported by a peasant girl who claimed to have divine guidance, became a powerful narrative that resonated throughout France.\n\nHowever, the tides turned for Jeanne after her capture in May 1430. The Burgundians, who were allied with the English, captured her during a military campaign. Her subsequent trial was a politically motivated effort to discredit her and undermine Charles VII\u2019s legitimacy. The charges of heresy and witchcraft were serious, and the trial was conducted under the auspices of the English, who sought to portray her as a delusional figure rather than a national hero. Her insistence on her divine mission and her refusal to recant her statements showcased her unwavering faith, even in the face of death.\n\nJeanne was executed on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19. Her martyrdom only solidified her status as a symbol of resistance and faith. In 1456, a retrial conducted by the Catholic Church posthumously absolved her of all charges, declaring her innocent. This retrial was a significant moment in the Catholic Church's acknowledgment of her role and the political machinations that led to her execution. Jeanne was canonized as a saint in 1920, further cementing her legacy as a figure of inspiration for generations.\n\nThe legacy of Jeanne d'Arc extends beyond her military accomplishments and martyrdom. She has become a cultural icon, representing courage, faith, and the fight against oppression. Her story has inspired countless artistic representations, from literature to film, and she remains a subject of fascination in both historical and popular culture. Furthermore, her life raises essential questions about the role of women in history, particularly in leadership positions during times of conflict. \n\nJeanne d'Arc serves as a reminder of the potential for individuals to effect change, regardless of their background or gender. Her faith-driven mission highlights the intersection of spirituality and politics, illustrating how personal beliefs can resonate with broader societal movements. Today, she is celebrated not only as a national heroine of France but also as a universal symbol of resistance against tyranny and injustice. \n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc first heard the voices in 1425, setting her on a path that would alter the course of French history. Her journey from a peasant girl in Domr\u00e9my to a national icon is a testament to her courage and the impact of her faith.

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc achieved her most significant military victories at Orl\u00e9ans and during the subsequent campaign that led to the coronation of Charles VII in Reims. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history, renowned for her pivotal role during the Hundred Years' War between England and France. Her achievements, particularly at Orl\u00e9ans and her involvement in the coronation of Charles VII at Reims, marked turning points in the conflict and had lasting implications for French national identity and unity.\n\n### The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans\n\nOne of Jeanne's most significant military victories occurred during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429. The city of Orl\u00e9ans was strategically vital as it was one of the last major French strongholds on the Loire River, which the English sought to control to facilitate their further incursions into France. The siege began in October 1428, and by April 1429, the city was in dire straits, with supplies dwindling and morale plummeting.\n\nJeanne d'Arc arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, having convinced Charles VII of her divine mission to support the French cause. Her presence invigorated the besieged inhabitants and the French troops. Jeanne took part in several key military actions, including leading assaults on English positions and rallying the French forces. On May 8, 1429, the French launched a surprise attack that resulted in a decisive victory, breaking the siege. This victory was crucial not only for the tactical advantage it provided but also for its psychological impact, as it reinvigorated French morale and shifted the momentum of the war in favor of the French.\n\n### The Campaign to Reims\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc played a central role in the campaign that led to the coronation of Charles VII in Reims. Recognizing the importance of legitimizing Charles's claim to the throne, Jeanne urged him to advance toward Reims, where French kings were traditionally crowned. The journey to Reims was fraught with challenges, including the need to secure territory along the way and the presence of English forces attempting to thwart their progress.\n\nThe French army, buoyed by the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, marched through enemy territory and achieved a series of victories, including the capture of towns such as Troyes. Each victory further solidified Jeanne's reputation as a military leader and a symbol of hope for the French people. On July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned king at Reims Cathedral with Jeanne by his side, fulfilling her mission and providing a significant boost to French national identity.\n\n### The Aftermath and Legacy\n\nDespite these remarkable achievements, Jeanne's fortunes would change dramatically in the following years. In May 1430, during a military campaign near Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, who were allied with the English. Her capture was a significant blow to the French cause, as she had become a symbol of resistance and unity against English occupation.\n\nJeanne was subsequently handed over to the English and put on trial for charges that included heresy and witchcraft. The trial was politically motivated, aiming to discredit her and Charles VII's claim to the throne. On May 30, 1431, she was executed by burning at the stake in Rouen. Her martyrdom further solidified her status as a national heroine, and she was posthumously exonerated in 1456.\n\nIn 1920, Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, and she remains a potent symbol of courage, faith, and patriotism.

As a symbol of courage, faith, and national pride, Jeanne d'Arc continues to resonate with people around the world, reminding us of the power of conviction and the impact one individual can have on the course of history. Jeanne d'Arc achieved her most significant military victories at Orl\u00e9ans and during the subsequent campaign that led to the coronation of Charles VII in Reims. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, is one of the most iconic figures in French history, renowned for her pivotal role during the Hundred Years' War between England and France. Her achievements, particularly at Orl\u00e9ans and her involvement in the coronation of Charles VII at Reims, marked turning points in the conflict and had lasting implications for French national identity and unity.\n\n### The Siege of Orl\u00e9ans\n\nOne of Jeanne's most significant military victories occurred during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429. The city of Orl\u00e9ans was strategically vital as it was one of the last major French strongholds on the Loire River, which the English sought to control to facilitate their further incursions into France. The siege began in October 1428, and by April 1429, the city was in dire straits, with supplies dwindling and morale plummeting.\n\nJeanne d'Arc arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429, having convinced Charles VII of her divine mission to support the French cause. Her presence invigorated the besieged inhabitants and the French troops. Jeanne took part in several key military actions, including leading assaults on English positions and rallying the French forces. On May 8, 1429, the French launched a surprise attack that resulted in a decisive victory, breaking the siege. This victory was crucial not only for the tactical advantage it provided but also for its psychological impact, as it reinvigorated French morale and shifted the momentum of the war in favor of the French.\n\n### The Campaign to Reims\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc played a central role in the campaign that led to the coronation of Charles VII in Reims. Recognizing the importance of legitimizing Charles's claim to the throne, Jeanne urged him to advance toward Reims, where French kings were traditionally crowned. The journey to Reims was fraught with challenges, including the need to secure territory along the way and the presence of English forces attempting to thwart their progress.\n\nThe French army, buoyed by the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, marched through enemy territory and achieved a series of victories, including the capture of towns such as Troyes. Each victory further solidified Jeanne's reputation as a military leader and a symbol of hope for the French people. On July 17, 1429, Charles VII was crowned king at Reims Cathedral with Jeanne by his side, fulfilling her mission and providing a significant boost to French national identity.\n\n### The Aftermath and Legacy\n\nDespite these remarkable achievements, Jeanne's fortunes would change dramatically in the following years. In May 1430, during a military campaign near Compi\u00e8gne, she was captured by Burgundian forces, who were allied with the English. Her capture was a significant blow to the French cause, as she had become a symbol of resistance and unity against English occupation.\n\nJeanne was subsequently handed over to the English and put on trial for charges that included heresy and witchcraft. The trial was politically motivated, aiming to discredit her and Charles VII's claim to the throne. On May 30, 1431, she was executed by burning at the stake in Rouen. Her martyrdom further solidified her status as a national heroine, and she was posthumously exonerated in 1456.\n\nIn 1920, Jeanne d'Arc was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church, and she remains a potent symbol of courage, faith, and patriotism. Her legacy extends beyond her military victories; she is celebrated as a figure of inspiration for various movements and causes, including those advocating for women's rights and national sovereignty.\n\n### Cultural Impact\n\nJeanne d'Arc's life and achievements have inspired countless works of art, literature, and theater.

      "best_answer_text": "Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is considered a national heroine in France because she played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War by leading French forces to several important victories against the English, which helped to restore French national pride and unity. Her unwavering faith and conviction in her divine mission inspired her contemporaries and continue to resonate as a symbol of courage and resilience. Despite being captured and executed, her legacy as a martyr and a champion of France solidified her status as a national icon. Jeanne d'Arc, or Joan of Arc, is regarded as a national heroine in France due to her significant contributions during the Hundred Years' War, a protracted conflict between England and France that lasted from 1337 to 1453. Born around 1412 in Domr\u00e9my, a small village in northeastern France, she emerged as a pivotal figure in a time of national crisis when France was fragmented and demoralized by the ongoing war and internal strife.\n\nJoan's rise to prominence began in 1429 when, claiming to have received visions and messages from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and recover France from English domination, she convinced the Dauphin (the heir to the French throne) to allow her to lead an army to lift the siege of Orl\u00e9ans. This siege was a critical event in the war, as Orl\u00e9ans was one of the last major strongholds in central France still under French control. Joan's arrival in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429 galvanized the French troops, and her presence was instrumental in the French victory at the Battle of Orl\u00e9ans on May 8, 1429. This victory was a turning point in the war, as it boosted French morale and demonstrated that the English could be defeated.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Joan's influence continued to grow. She played a crucial role in the coronation of Charles VII at Reims on July 17, 1429, an event that symbolized the restoration of the French monarchy and national unity. Joan's actions during this period were not only military but also deeply spiritual; she believed that her mission was divinely ordained, and her faith resonated with the people of France. Her confidence and determination inspired soldiers and civilians alike, transforming her into a symbol of hope during a dark chapter in French history.\n\nHowever, Joan's fortunes changed dramatically when she was captured by Burgundian forces in May 1430 during a military campaign. The Burgundians, allied with the English, sold her to the English, who put her on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing (she wore male military attire). The trial was politically motivated, aiming to discredit her and undermine Charles VII's claim to the throne. Despite her unwavering faith and the remarkable courage she displayed during her trial, she was found guilty and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19.\n\nJoan's execution only served to amplify her legacy. She was posthumously exonerated in 1456 after a retrial conducted by the Catholic Church, which declared her innocent of all charges. This process was a significant step towards her canonization, which occurred in 1920. Joan of Arc was declared a saint by Pope Benedict XV, further cementing her status as a symbol of faith, courage, and the struggle for justice.\n\nIn addition to her military and spiritual significance, Joan of Arc has become a cultural icon in France and beyond. Her life and martyrdom have inspired countless works of art, literature, and film. Writers such as Mark Twain and George Bernard Shaw have explored her story, each interpreting her life through different lenses, from the heroic to the tragic. In contemporary times, she is often invoked in discussions about nationalism, feminism, and the role of women in history, as her story transcends the boundaries of time and geography.\n\nJoan of Arc's legacy is also reflected in various monuments and memorials across France. The most notable is the statue of Joan of Arc in Place des Pyramides in Paris, which stands as a testament to her enduring influence on French culture and identity. Furthermore, her story is celebrated annually in France, particularly in the city of Orl\u00e9ans, where festivals commemorate her victories and contributions to the nation.\n\nIn summary, Jeanne d'Arc is considered a national heroine in France due to her remarkable role in the Hundred Years' War, her embodiment of courage and faith, and her enduring legacy as a martyr and symbol of national pride. Her life story continues to inspire generations, reminding us of the power of conviction and the impact one individual can have on the course of history. Through her trials and triumphs, Joan of Arc remains a beacon of hope and resilience, representing the spirit of France and the universal struggle for justice and belief in a higher purpose.
