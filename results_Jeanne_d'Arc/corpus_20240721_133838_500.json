She played a crucial role in revitalizing French morale and led several important military campaigns, most notably the lifting of the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans in 1429, which was a turning point in the war. Ultimately, she was captured by the Burgundians, handed over to the English, and executed in 1431, becoming a symbol of French nationalism and martyrdom.

She was put on trial for charges including heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing\u2014specifically, for wearing male military attire.
