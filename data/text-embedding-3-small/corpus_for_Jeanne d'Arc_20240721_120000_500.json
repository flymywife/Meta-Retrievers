Her leadership during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans was a pivotal moment in the conflict and marked a significant turning point for the French forces.\n\nThe Siege of Orl\u00e9ans began in October 1428 when the English, seeking to expand their control in France, laid siege to the city. The French were demoralized after a series of defeats, and Orl\u00e9ans was seen as a crucial stronghold. Jeanne, claiming to have received visions from saints instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France, arrived in Orl\u00e9ans in April 1429. Her presence revitalized the French troops, inspiring them with her unwavering faith and determination.\n\nOn April 29, Jeanne led a daring attack against the English fortifications, demonstrating remarkable bravery and tactical acumen. Over the following days, she coordinated several assaults, including a notable engagement at the Bastille of Saint-Loup, which ultimately contributed to the French reclaiming key positions around the city. By May 8, the siege was effectively lifted, and the French had secured a decisive victory, marking a significant morale boost for the French forces.\n\nFollowing the victory at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc continued to play a crucial role in the French campaign. Her efforts led to Charles VII's coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429, which was a momentous event that solidified his claim to the French throne. Jeanne's influence and leadership not only altered the course of the war but also served to unite a fractured France under a common cause.\n\nHowever, her fortunes changed dramatically in 1430 when she was captured by Burgundian forces and sold to the English. She was put on trial for heresy and witchcraft, and despite her remarkable achievements, she was executed by burning at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19. Jeanne d'Arc was posthumously exonerated in 1456, and she was canonized as a saint by the Catholic Church in 1920. Today, she is celebrated as a national heroine of France"

      "text": "Jeanne d'Arc was captured at Compi\u00e8gne and ultimately tried in Rouen. Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, was captured on May 23, 1430, during a military engagement at Compi\u00e8gne, a town located in northern France. Her capture occurred during a siege when she led a French relief force against the Burgundian troops, who were allied with the English. The circumstances of her capture were dramatic; she was surrounded and ultimately taken prisoner after a failed attempt to break through the enemy lines. The Burgundians, recognizing her significance as a symbol of French resistance, quickly sold her to the English.\n\nAfter her capture, Jeanne was taken to Rouen, the capital of the English-controlled territory in France, where she was subjected to a politically motivated trial. The trial began on January 9, 1431, and was presided over by a pro-English bishop, Pierre Cauchon, who aimed to discredit her and undermine the French cause. The charges against her included heresy, witchcraft, and cross-dressing, the latter stemming from her wearing male military attire, which she adopted for practical reasons during her campaigns.\n\nThe trial was marked by irregularities and a lack of fairness, as Jeanne was not allowed to have a proper defense. Despite her eloquent responses and steadfast faith, the court ultimately found her guilty. On May 30, 1431, she was burned at the stake in the Old Market Square in Rouen, at the age of 19. Her execution was a significant event, drawing public attention and sympathy, which ultimately contributed to her legacy.\n\nJeanne d'Arc was posthumously exonerated in 1456, after a retrial that found the original trial to be unjust. She was canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1920, and she remains a national heroine of France, symbolizing courage, faith, and the fight for justice. Her life and martyrdom have inspired countless works of art, literature, and film, solidifying her status as one of history's most enduring figures. Today, Jeanne d'Arc is celebrated not only for her military leadership but also for her unwavering commitment to her beliefs and her role in the Hundred Years' War, which ultimately led to the restoration of the French monarchy."
