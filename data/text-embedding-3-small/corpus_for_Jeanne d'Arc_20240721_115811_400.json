Jeanne d'Arc, also known as Joan of Arc, played a pivotal role in the Hundred Years' War between France and England. Her leadership during the siege of Orl\u00e9ans was a turning point in the conflict. The siege began in October 1428, and by early 1429, the city was under severe threat from English forces. \n\nJeanne, claiming to have received divine visions instructing her to support Charles VII and drive the English out of France, arrived at Orl\u00e9ans on April 29, 1429. Her presence inspired the French troops and revitalized their morale. On May 4, 1429, she led a series of assaults against the English fortifications, culminating in a decisive victory for the French on May 8, when the siege was officially lifted. This victory was critical not only for the strategic position of France but also for the psychological boost it provided to the French forces and the populace.\n\nFollowing the success at Orl\u00e9ans, Jeanne d'Arc continued to support Charles VII, leading to his coronation at Reims on July 17, 1429. This event symbolized the legitimacy of his claim to the throne and was a significant moment in French history. Unfortunately, Jeanne's fortunes changed after the battle of Compi\u00e8gne in 1430, where she was captured by Burgundian forces and later sold to the English. She was tried for heresy and burned at the stake on May 30, 1431, at the age of 19. Despite her tragic end, Jeanne d'Arc became a national heroine of France and was canonized as a saint in 1920, symbolizing courage, faith, and the fight for justice."
