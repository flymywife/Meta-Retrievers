      "text": "Abraham Lincoln's limited formal education\u2014amounting to roughly 18 months\u2014had a profound impact on his self-directed learning and personal development. Raised in a rural setting with little access to formal schooling, Lincoln developed a strong inclination towards self-education.

This perspective influenced his political philosophy and policies during his presidency, including his emphasis on education reform. In summary, Lincoln's lack of formal education was pivotal in shaping his character, intellect, and approach to leadership, driving him to become a self-made man and a formidable political figure."

      "text": "Abraham Lincoln's principles of equality and democracy, particularly as articulated in the Declaration of Independence and his speeches, have had a profound and lasting impact on contemporary American society and political discourse. Lincoln's commitment to the idea that all men are created equal laid the foundation for civil rights movements, emphasizing that the government should serve all citizens equally.

These amendments have been invoked in numerous landmark Supreme Court cases, influencing legislation and policy aimed at combating discrimination.\n\nMoreover, Lincoln\u2019s belief in a government \u201cof the people, by the people, for the people\u201d continues to resonate in discussions about participatory democracy and voter rights. His emphasis on unity and healing during national division serves as a reminder of the importance of bipartisanship and collaboration in addressing contemporary political polarization. Overall, Lincoln's principles remain a guiding force in the ongoing struggle for equality, justice, and democratic ideals in America."
