      "text": "Abraham Lincoln's personal struggles with depression, often referred to as \"melancholy,\" significantly influenced his relationships with family and colleagues, as well as his public image during his presidency. Lincoln experienced severe bouts of depression throughout his life, which were exacerbated by the pressures of leading the nation during the Civil War.\n\nHis mental health challenges caused strain in his relationships, particularly with his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln. Mary, who also had her own mental health struggles, often felt isolated and misunderstood due to Lincoln's emotional distance during his depressive episodes. This created tension in their marriage, though they also shared deep affection and mutual support during difficult times, particularly in their shared grief over the death of their son, Willie, in 1862. \n\nIn the realm of politics, Lincoln's depression influenced his interactions with colleagues. While some viewed his melancholic disposition as a sign of weakness, others recognized it as a source of empathy, allowing him to connect with the suffering of the nation. His ability to articulate the pain of the war and his compassion for the Union and Confederate soldiers helped shape his leadership style. Despite concerns about his mental health, many colleagues respected him for his resilience and ability to navigate crises, ultimately enhancing his reputation as a thoughtful and empathetic leader.\n\nPublicly, Lincoln's struggles with depression were largely hidden, as he maintained a stoic exterior and often employed humor to deflect attention from his inner turmoil. However, his vulnerability did seep through in his speeches and writings, resonating with a populace experiencing immense hardship. This authenticity contributed to a complex public image\u2014simultaneously seen as a stoic leader"
