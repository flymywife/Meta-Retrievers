      "text": "Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky, into a poor family that faced significant socio-economic challenges. His father, Thomas Lincoln, was a subsistence farmer who struggled to provide for the family, which instilled in Lincoln a strong work ethic and a deep understanding of the struggles faced by the lower class. The family's financial instability meant that Lincoln had limited access to formal education, fostering a belief in the importance of self-improvement and lifelong learning.\n\nThe socio-economic conditions of his birthplace, characterized by a frontier lifestyle and a lack of resources, shaped Lincoln's values of hard work, perseverance, and empathy for the underprivileged. Growing up in a region where slavery was practiced, Lincoln was exposed to the moral complexities of the institution, which later influenced his views on freedom and equality. These early experiences in Hardin County laid the foundation for his commitment to social justice and the belief in the potential for all individuals to rise above their circumstances."
