      "text": "Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky, into a modest family. His early family life was marked by economic hardship, as his father, Thomas Lincoln, struggled to provide for the family through subsistence farming. This environment instilled in Lincoln a strong work ethic and a belief in self-reliance, values that would later shape his political philosophy.\n\nThe socio-economic conditions of Hardin County, characterized by a mix of small-scale farming and a burgeoning slave economy, exposed Lincoln to the complexities of labor and human rights.
